  "description": "After two decades, Niagara Falls' bouldering area, the Niagara Glen, finally has a bouldering guidebook it deserves. Supported by the community, this colourful guidebook features hundreds of problems and everything you could want in a bouldering guidebook: over 800 problems from V0 to V12, beautiful hand-drawn maps, GPS coordinates, pages for notes and beta, tick lists, climbing-inspired art, quality photography from contributors, history of the Niagara Glen, and detailed problem descriptions.The Niagara Glen is a cherished climbing area, but for the past several years \u2013 even with guidebooks \u2013 climbers continually get lost in the forest. This guidebook solves that problem with up-to-date info, as much has changed over the years (holds have fallen off, and some problems have fallen out of use).",
