  "description": "Clad in light and strong grade 5 titanium armour, the 9 Peak contains full multisport GPS functionality into a cuff-friendly design. For your urban runs and races, the new Snap-to-Route feature matches your GPS track to your preloaded route. Precisely matching your GPS track to your course for more accurate pace and distance data. This precision is great for training for races that wind through canyons of glass and steel, or any other feature that can interfere with a GPS signal. Intelligent power management software tracks your battery\u2019s status. Modes and settings can be changed on the fly, giving you enough power for that last kilometer, or the next 50. Loaded with more than 80 activity profiles, the 9-series is ready for your next run, or your next game of jai alai. The optical heart rate monitor adds an extra layer of precision to your training. Pair your watch with a compatible smartphone running the Suunto app and the 9-series\u2019s gains a whole new feature set. The app lets you interact with other fitness apps, transfer activities, receive notifications (calls, texts, reminders, etc.), plan routes using heatmaps, share activities and more. Full activity tracking features record your steps and calories, as well as monitor the quality of your sleep. This 24/7 performance is all part of calculating your recovery times and tracking your progress.Rugged components reduce the weight from the stainless version by 15% and pair well with a virtually scratchproof sapphire crystal face.Snap to route matches your GPS track to your preloaded route (aka a .GPX file), removing inaccurate GPS plot points that add distance and lead to inaccurate pace data. Snap to route has a 100m buffer, once you go past 100m, your route will be plotted by GPS, and not by your preloaded route. But once you are within 20m of your planned route, the snap to route will kick back in. The end result is tracked activities that look accurate and precise, like they were drawn with a ruler, and not by your non dominant hand.Equipped with LifeQ\u2019s optical heart rate monitor, which provides blood oxygen level information as well as reliable constant heart rate data, allowing you to train without a chest strap.Heatmaps display other Suunto user\u2019s activities over local maps, making it easy to find the best runs, rides, trails, or swims, wherever Suunto users play.FusedTrack\u2122 uses data from the internal sensors to plot your route between GPS points. By combining the data, you get a track that mirrors your actual track, while only checking into GPS once or twice a minute, greatly increasing battery life, ranging from 25-170h with GPS recording.FusedSpeed\u2122 combines GPS and accelerometer data to provide a more stable running pace.Pre-set intelligent battery profiles change modes to get specific runtimes and features out of the remaining battery.Custom battery profiles allow you to set-up exactly what you need for an activity. Saving these modes lets you have specific battery profiles for different activities.Low battery detection mode switches off everything but the activity timer.Free Suunto app lets you connect and sync to your favourite training apps, like Strava\u00ae, Training Peaks\u00ae and Komoot\u00ae.Suunto app enables sharing metrics with coaches and personal trainers, opening up a whole world of digital training plans and tips.Loaded with more than 80 different sport modes, from running, swimming, cycling and many more, there is a sport specific mode for nearly every activity.GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and QZSS satellite constellation support for strong signal anywhere.24/7 activity tracking, learning your activity level and guiding you towards a more active lifestyle.Sleep tracking monitors the quality of your sleep, when you turn in and total sleep, using this data to calculate recovery times and progress.Tilt compensated digital compass.Barometric altimeter helps you track your ascents, descents and total elevation changes.Altitude acclimation is calculated through altitude data and blood oxygenation data.Storm alarm tracks pressure changes.Ambient light sensor adjusts screen backlight to match your current conditions.Bluetooth Smart connects to a myriad of fitness sensors, from power meters to foot pods, as well as phones.Automatically syncs data to paired phones running the free Suunto app.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) via Bluetooth.Free software updates via Bluetooth, add functionality and improve performance.Fast-charging USB power cord can charge from 0-100% in 1 hour (when paired with fast-charging USB port).Charging cable attaches to the watch with magnets.User-friendly strap changes, thanks to quick-release pins. Fits any 22mm wide strap.Fits wrists 12.5-17.5cm.Suunto app grants access to the included Suunto Value Pack, giving you premium access to some of the most popular training apps on the market, including: 60-day Strava Summit trial, 30-day Training Peaks premium membership, 3-months of Relive club, a 90-day SportTracks membership and more.In the box: Suunto 9 Peak, USB cable and documentation.",
