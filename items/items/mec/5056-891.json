  "description": "A subtle remix of MEC's time-tested pants for rock climbing and bouldering (that's the R and B in the name). A bit of spandex in the burly nylon fabric adds a little extra give on long moves and high steps. A gusseted crotch, knee darts and shockcord-adjustable hems leave your legs and feet free to move. Double-layered fabric in the seat won't wear through in a single season.Made of light yet durable nylon and spandex.Streamlined cut slides easily under a harness, but it's roomy enough for full mobility.Waistband is flat in the back with extra-high coverage and elasticated in the front with a drawstring for a secure fit.Front hand pockets have mesh pocket bags to add ventilation.Dedicated side brush pocket for easy access on scruffy routes.\n\nRegular fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nGarments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nOur next to skin fit that contours the body for no distractions\n\n\n\n\n\nOur close to body fit with a low profile silhouette for ease of movement\n\n\n\n\n\nOur standard, slightly off body fit for unrestricted comfort\n\n\n\n\n\nOur roomy, off body fit for maximum comfort and easy layering\n\n\nAll MEC men\u2019s and boy\u2019s pants are regular rise.\n\n\n\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
