  "description": "Not all storms are bad. Black Diamond has taken its already impressive flagship headlamp and improved it. With a streamlined light head, a dedicated mode button and a nice bump in lumens, the Storm 400 headlamp is the most advanced version ever. Signature features like smooth PowerTap\u2122, dimming, flood and spot lighting, and a red, green and blue night mode are now even easier to use.Flood and spot light modes give you the right type of light for both near and far.Smooth dimming feature lets you dial in the perfect brightness.PowerTap technology goes from any brightness mode to full power with a tap on the light's housing. Tap again to return to the previous output.Mode memory remembers the last setting used and turns the light on in that setting.Strobe mode helps keep you seen.Red light modes help preserve night vision.Intuitive 2-button controls give you easy access to red lighting and flipping between spot and flood lighting.IP67 waterproofing protects the light all the way up to 1m of submersion for up to 30 minutes. Note: If your light does get seriously wet, be sure to dry it out completely before storing it.3-level LED power meter lets you know how your batteries are doing.Lock-out mode prevents accidental activation, so you don\u2019t pull out a dead headlamp just when you need it.Regulated output maximizes battery life.Red, green and blue night vision modes have dimming and strobe modes.",
