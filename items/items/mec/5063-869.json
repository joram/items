  "description": "Replacement pads and springs for Shimano\u00ae disc brakes. Compared to metal pads, the resin compound is quiet, generates less heat, and offers more progressive stopping power (no sudden braking). The only compromise? Resin has a shorter lifespan than metal, especially under wet conditions.Comes with 1 left and 1 right pad for 1 set of brakes.To replace both front and rear brakes, you will require 2 sets of these brake pads.Compatible with Shimano BR-C501, BR-M575, BR-M525, BR-M495, BR-M486, BR-M485, BR-M475, BR-M465, BR-M447, BR-M446, BR-M445, BR-M416, BR-M416A, BR-M415, BR-M4050, BR-M3050, BR-M395, BR-M375, BR-M365, BR-M355, BR-M315, BR-T675, BR-T615, BR-TX805, and BR-MT500 disc brake calipers.Also compatible with TRP Spyre, Tektro Dorado HD-715, Orion, Gemini, Auriga, Volans, Auriga, Aquila, Aries and Mira brakes.",
