  "description": "A pocket guide for fledging birders. Beautifully illustrated with 160 of North America\u2019s top species, from the tiny house wren to the stately great blue heron. Short lists of facts, typical behaviors, and a colloquially written description of each bird make this book easier to digest than other text-dense field guides. Also includes photographs, range maps, and tips on observing and tracking birds.",
