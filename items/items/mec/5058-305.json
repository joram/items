  "description": "An outdoor classic for wet days. Redesigned based on member feedback, the updated Newt Suit returns to the durable, tried-and-true fabric of previous years. Taped seams and waterproof fabric stand up to wet playgrounds and rainy hikes, so kids stay dry and comfortable no matter where their explorations take them. Long zippers make for easier outfit changes when it's finally time to head inside.Made from the robust nylon of the previous versions, with a waterproof polyurethane coating.DWR finish for maximum water and mud shedding.Seams are fully taped throughout, so water can't work in through the seams.Provides full coverage without gaps and places to become untucked.2 water-resistant Uretek-coated front zips open to the waist, making it relatively easy to get on and off.Hood has a brim and elasticized sides to keep water drops away from the child's head and face.All cuffs are elasticized for a snug, comfortable fit.Reflective trim for heightened visibility.\n\nRelaxed fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nTight, with no room to spare.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery close fit, with a bit of room.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerous, but not oversized.\n\n\n\n\n\nOversized with lots of room for layers.\n\n\nAll MEC men\u2019s and boy\u2019s pants are regular rise.\n\n\n\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",

    "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.  Values under 8,000g/m2/24h provide low performance, 20,000g/m2/24h provide moderate performance and values over 30,000g/m2/24h provide high performance.": [

A wind-resistant garment resists some wind, but not as much as a garment that is windproof.": [
