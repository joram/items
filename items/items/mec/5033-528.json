  "description": "If you've been wondering if minimalism and natural running are right for you, let this book be your guide. Minimalist shoes and barefoot running are hot topics. Some say that running in lighter, lower shoes leads to better form and fewer injuries, others caution that ditching your regular shoes can actually increase the risk of injury. Veteran running writer Scott Douglas draws on the knowledge of running coaches and experts to explain why many runners might benefit from minimalism. Use the simple tests to determine if you're ready, then learn how to successfully transition from conventional running shoes to minimalist shoes, how to prepare, and stay injury free.",
