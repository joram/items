  "description": "We've probably said this before, but the Alpine Ally layers really are a champagne product on a PBR budget. The 3-layer nylon offers the performance of well-known fabrics, but the raw material costs considerably less. They have a full set of backcountry-worthy features: contoured waist band and a fly, shockcord at the hems and taped seams to keep them waterproof. Cut to slide over hiking or mountaineering boots (but too slim for most ski boots) they are robust enough for all-mountain adventures from trailhead to summit.3-layer 70-denier nylon with a waterproof-breathable laminate and DWR finishSeams are taped and fully waterproof.Contoured waistband has belt loops and a zippered fly.Zippered thigh pocket has an expandable gusset, key hook and storm flap to keep out rain.3/4 side zips with 2 top sliders for venting, 1 bottom slider to ease on over mountaineering or hiking boots.Knee articulation darts increase your range of motion.Reinforced polyester and Kevlar kick patches resist abrasion.Snap adjustable cuffs have a boot lace hook and grommets for adding your own instep cord.Recco\u00ae Rescue System reflector is detectable by ski patrol and rescue teams. Useful for resort skiing, it is not a substitute for skills training, beacons, or smart decision-making in the backcountry.\n\nRegular fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nGarments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use.
