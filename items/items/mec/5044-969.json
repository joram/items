  "description": "When V2 slopers feel like V12 during the heat of summer, slap on a bit of this. When used as a base for regular chalk, liquid chalk provides an extra layer of grip for friction dependent projects or super-hot days.No more dust! Good for those with chalk allergies or for at-home hangboard use.Keeps your hands dry without having to re-chalk when working longer boulder problems.Compact 200ml size fits into your chalk bucket pocket.",
