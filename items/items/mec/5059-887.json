  "description": "A little rough weather should not prevent junior funhogs from getting outside. This fleece-lined jacket uses waterproof-breathable fabric to ensure dryness through wet and windy conditions. Warm enough for cool fall days (or west-coast winters), it's designed to fit easily over layers if the conditions call for extra insulation.Relaxed fit offers plenty of space to layer and room to grow.Shell is abrasion-resistant 75-denier polyester with a polyurethane waterproof breathable coating and a DWR (durable water repellency) finish.Fully lined with soft polyester fleece that adds a bit more warmth for cool days.Fleece -lined hand pockets for thawing fingers.Storm flap snaps down over the zipper and keeps weather out.Elasticized cuffs and hood edges seal out the cold and damp.Dropped hem provides a little extra coverage from the elements.Reflective details for low-light visibility.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
