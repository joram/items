  "description": "If you are travelling in high alpine environments in \u201cspring\u201d, it\u2019s best to leave nothing to chance. Enter the Antelope. This 3-season bag is light, compressible, and extremely weather resistant. Insulated with 26 ounces of high lofting goose down, it will keep you warm through three seasons and well into the fourth. A full 3-D down filled Super Collar and a robust draft tube trap the warm air you worked so hard to produce. The narrow, but not tight, profile (62in. across the shoulder) makes the bag compact and quick to heat. It is constructed with no side-block baffles so you can distribute the down depending on the temperature. The 5.25in. baffles offer excellent down control. All in all this is one of the most substantial 3-season bags available today.Shell, collar, and draft tube are GORE\u2122 WINDSTOPPER\u00ae 830 fabric, which is light and compressible.Lining is made of 20-denier plain weave nylon.Insulated with goose down.Locking #5 YKK zipper.When ordering please specify left or right zip. It is easier to reach across your body and zip up on the opposite side \u2013 left zip if you are right-handed and right zip if you are left-handed.",
