  "description": "The Direto XR merges Elite\u2019s Direto line with their Drivo line, making more power and more climbing, more affordable. When it's time to take your winter training to the next level (and cut down on worn trainer tires), direct drive trainers are the way to go. Control it with apps and software via ANT+ FE-C and Bluetooth smart to reproduce the steepness of the course you're riding. With a maximum incline of 24%, you'll be able to ride the equivalent of Scanuppia (if your legs allow it). If you're a green jersey type, the Direto XR provides up to 2300W of resistance at 40km/h for tough, out of the saddle sprints. If you're going to put the effort in to follow a power-based training program, this one has a power accuracy of 1.5%, comparable to most stand-alone power meters.5.1kg flywheel results in a very smooth outdoor-like pedalling feel.Direct-drive set up keeps the noise level low.Optical Torque Sensor (OTS) provides precise power measurement within 1.5%.Can simulate gradients up to 24% and has a max resistance of over 2300W at 40km/h.Choose a course or a training program via the included Elite RealSoftware or My E-training app and resistance adjusts automatically.Trainer is compatible with interactive apps like Zwift (30-day trial included), Trainer Road, Kinomap, PerfPro, Veloreality and Virtual Training.Speed, cadence and power can broadcast via ANT+ and Bluetooth smart to your bike computer or phone.FE-C and Bluetooth smart control takes care of resistance adjustments.Compatible with 130mm QR, 135mm QR and 142x12mm axle standards.Wide, stable base can be folded for easy transport and storage.Can use 120-240V power outlet for optimal compatibility when travelling.3 LED lights provides feedback on what is connected.Compatible with SRAM and Shimano 9/10/11-speed cassettes.Campagnolo freehub adapter sold separately.Folded dimensions: 30 x 55 x 65cm.Includes 11-speed Shimano 105 cassette, front-wheel riser block, QR skewer, axle spacers, power adapter and documentation.",
