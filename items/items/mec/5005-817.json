The area has rugged characteristics that whitewater paddlers crave, but it also has many waterways for novice or cautious paddlers. The author \u2013 who has decades of experience as a guide and wilderness tripper \u2013 outlines options for paddlers of all abilities. Areas covered include Ottawa Valley Northwest, Montreal River, Makobe River, Mattawa River, Petawawa River, Barron River, and many more.",
