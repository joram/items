  "description": "These boots are made for shredding and blurring the line between freeski and AT. A redesigned ski/walk mechanism and buckle system is robust and combines touring efficiency with downhill performance. The unique  tongue is designed for easy touring and easy entry, and it offers more forward flex than a regularly styled tongue. This newest version features a Recco\u00ae reflector in the power strap, which can be located by rescue crews at many ski areas in the event. Tech fittings and a stiff Intuition liner round out this hard-charging package.Pebax\u00ae Rnew\u00ae shell provides downhill performance in a lightweight package.Cuff is Pebax\u00ae Rnew\u00ae with Outdry\u00ae venting to keep things stiff and well ventilated.Pebax\u00ae Rnew\u00ae is a partially plant-based polymer derived from castor seeds.Axial alpine evo tongue is made of Pebax and blends overlap and cabrio style entry.Wave closure system uses a self-equalizing cable and a single buckle for a secure fit.Heel retention strap keeps the heel locked in nicely for a blister-free tour.Intuition\u00ae Cross Fit Pro Flex G liner is thermoformable for a custom fit.Quickstep fittings and fitting indicator simplify the process of getting your boots on and off.Speedlock Plus ski/walk mechanism offers friction-free touring efficiency with downhill performance.Vibram\u00ae Cayman PRO sole has a smooth rubber toe and lugged rubber profile to reduce snow build up and provide grip.Recco\u00ae reflector in power strap can be detected by rescue crews in many ski areas. Not a substitute for avalanche transceiver and appropriate knowledge when travelling in the backcountry.Flex index is 110.",
