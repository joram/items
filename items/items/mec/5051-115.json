  "description": "The Force is strong on boulders, sport routes, and in the gym. It can be summoned too on long routes, for those who are thinking bout crossing over to the dark side (cracks, muti-pitch trad) but still want to wear their comfy slippers.Uppers are 1.8mm suede for performance and fit.Padded mesh tongues for comfort.1.0mm Flexan midsole for control.Tensioned rand and midsole gives underfoot support and focuses power over the toes and forefoot as you weight the shoe.Vibram\u00ae XS Edge soles use harder rubber that let you weight tiny edges.Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size.",
