  "description": "Whether you\u2019re in the backcountry or your backyard, a good saw is an invaluable tool. Silky saws are regarded as some of the best on the market, and when you use the Accel, you\u2019ll see why. Lighter than an axe and more efficient than a large knife, this saw will revolutionize the way you maintain trails, collect firewood, or do anything else that requires cutting wood. Designed for professional arborists, the Accel is comfortable enough for all-day use or stocking up your woodpile for winter. And when you're done work for the day, it folds into a compact package for easy carrying.Tooth layout (6.4 teeth per inch) is designed for pruning and green wood.Non-slip rubber handle provides a secure, comfortable grip.Proprietary Silky Smooth Cutting Technology (MIRAI-ME) makes cutting a cinch.Rust-resistant, hard chrome-plated, taper-ground blade with an impulse-hardened non-set tooth design offers greater cutting efficiency.Blade locks securely in 2 open positions: in line with the handle for regular use and slightly angled.",
