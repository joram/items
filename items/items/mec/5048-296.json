  "description": "The Ski-Matic  is a totally new binding system designed specifically for ski touring. It solves the problem of fitting modern ski boots with rear regulation systems into crampons. With this design the back of the boot won't interfere with the closure of the crampon. Not too technical or fidgety to bring in the field, just step in heel first, then engage the front bail for a bomb-proof fit.10-point crampon to fit ski touring boots.Front is carbon steel, rear section is light aluminum alloy. \nLight, compact fits into a day-sized touring pack.Front binding fits modern plastic ski touring boots and it is not guaranteed for traditional mountaineering boots.",
