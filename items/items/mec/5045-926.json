  "description": "Compact, with great handling, and a good diameter for a cragging rope. Ideal for intermediate climbers looking to project routes and progress up grades.Beal ropes have lower impact forces than most brands. This reduces forces on the anchor, belayer, and climber.Thermo fluid treatment stabilizes the sheath and keeps it compact for better handling.No chemical treatments or dyes used in the construction.Beal plants a tree for every rope sold.",
