  "description": "Like your commuter bike, this sleek pannier blends beauty with utility. The fabric provides weather-resistant good looks and seals with a fold over flap closure to block passing showers. A German-engineered attachment system clips the Division securely to your rack. On arrival, a one-button release makes it easy to remove and bring with you.Main fabric is water resistant 400-denier high tenacity nylon.Back panel is 600-denier polyester with a water resistant embossed TPU coating.Fabrics are highly water-resistant but the bag is not seam taped, so it is not fully waterproof.Internal backboard keeps the pannier shapely.Rixen and Kaul Modul attachment system has spring-loaded top hooks that adjust to fit rails from 8 to 16mm. Top hooks and lower catch hook adjust horizontally to fit almost any rack geometry.Fold over flap with snag-resistant Velcro closure and an internal draw string closure keeps weather out.Handy magnets keep the drawstring adjustment cord in place as you pedal.Sturdy eyelets allow you to clip in the removable webbing shoulder strap.Large slip-in internal pocket holds a U-lock and a small elastic loop stores your pump.Zippered external front pocket has a key clip.Reflective accents and light loops on both sides enhance visibility.Fits the World Tour/Division Pannier Rain Cover in size small (sold separately).",
