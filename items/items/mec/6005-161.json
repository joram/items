  "description": "3 large, asymmetric carabiners, great for belaying with 2 ropes or using with complex anchors. The notchless nose design will not get caught on webbing or bolts.Manual locking screwgate features a protective collar that prevents the nose from jamming under load.Asymmetric shape creates large internal space and wide opening.Squarish end helps it stay aligned.Slightly curved spine maximizes gate opening.",
