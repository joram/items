  "description": "Originally produced as a fundraiser for an around-the-world cruise on a Viking long ship, the Viking knife is just as useful today as it was 1000 years ago. Using a 3-layer carbon steel, the rugged blade retains its edge well and is easy to sharpen when the time comes. The barrel-shaped curly birch handle is comfortable in a variety of grips. A simple leather sheath keeps the knife close at hand while you're in the field.Helle laminated steel sandwiches a hard steel between two softer steel sides, giving the blade an excellent mix of toughness and edge retention without making it hard to sharpen.Scandinavian (Scandi) grind excels at bushcraft tasks.Comfortable barrel-shaped handle is sculpted out of curly birch.Leather sheath is embossed with traditional designs and hangs on a leather strap, placing the knife below the belt-line.Since 1932, Helle knives have been made in a small Norwegian village nestled between the mountains and fjords. Each Helle knife has passed through experienced hands on its way to your belt.Each knife has its own personality, and variations in colour and patterns mean no two are alike.",
