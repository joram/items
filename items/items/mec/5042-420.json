  "description": "From MEC, an insulated air pad that performs superbly, at a price point we're totally proud to offer. Using warm synthetic insulation, we opted for offset baffles \u2013 each one overlaps the next \u2013 so cold spots don't develop while you sleep, and we welded the insulation to the ends and bottom of the pad to prevent it from shifting too. For better nights, raised and larger outer chambers help keep you centered on the mat where it's nice and warm.Made of abrasion-resistant 75-denier polyester.Internal TPU laminate has welded seams keep the paid air tight.Offset internal baffles eliminate cold spots.120g of Primaloft Silver High Loft synthetic insulation provides warmth without weight or bulk.Raised outer chambers prevent you from rolling off.Bi-directional low-profile valve (with one port for inflation and one port for deflation).Use the Vectair Pump (sold separately) for quick inflation.Hook-and-loop strap keeps the pad rolled for storage.Stuff sack and repair kit included.",
