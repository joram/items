  "description": "Swiss-designed and beautifully crafted, the Cloudventure employs an innovative outsole to provide outstanding cushioning, grip and energy return on trails. The secret to the CloudTec\u00ae outsole is 11 distinct pods that compress when loaded, then spring back when you toe off. This unique structure provides cushioning on the horizontal plane as well as the vertical and works to offset the impacts of sustained downhill running. The outsole is overlaid with a thin speedboard that evens out the shoe's flex and supports a natural rolling foot motion. Up top, a beautiful 2-layer upper features a breathable engineered mesh outer layer over a soft and supportive inner layer. A luxe interior is comfortable from the get-go, and protective toe-and-heel bumpers provide extra confidence when things get technical.2-layer upper combines breathable engineered mesh with a supportive inner layer.Cushioning EVA midsole.Integrated speedboard imparts a natural flex, provides energy return and doubles as a rock plate.Unique CloudTec\u00ae pods compress and stretch upon impact to provide cushioning, improved grip and energy return.Micro-engineered grip rubber features multiple extruded textures to provide traction exactly where it's needed.",

    "Drop\n\nThe drop is the difference in height between the heel and the forefoot midsole cushioning. Traditional running shoes tend to have a 10mm drop or higher while minimalist style shoes are on the lower end of the spectrum.": [
      "6mm"
    ],
    "Feel\n\n'Minimal and natural' shoes offer low drop, lots of flex, and minimal cushioning. Most running shoes are 'Light and responsive' with medium cushioning and good energy return. 'Cushioned and floaty' shoes have maximum cushioning.": [
      "Light and responsive"
    ],
    "Heel-to-toe cushioning\n\nThe approximate thickness of the midsole cushioning under the heel and the forefoot. A thicker heel and greater difference between heel and toe height tends to suit heel-strike runners, while forefoot and midfoot strikers may prefer a minimal drop between heel and toe cushioning.": [
