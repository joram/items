  "description": "World Heritage Sites are designated by UNESCO, which selects only those sites that reflect the world's cultural and natural diversity and are of outstanding universal value. Sites that no longer meet these strict criteria are delisted, and there are currently 1,073 World Heritage Sites. The 42 new sites include Mistaken Point in Canada, the Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura in Germany, and Hebron/Al-Khalil Old Town in Palestine. Learn about all of them in the latest edition of World Heritage Sites.",
