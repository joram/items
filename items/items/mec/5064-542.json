  "description": "Built for mountainsides and summits, The Shield Sunglasses block harsh UV and look good doing it. The wide, deep lenses and removeable side shields block reflections and light coming in from odd angles. Julbo is known for their high-altitude optics, once you try them you'll see the reputation is earned.Zebra 2-4 lenses are photochromic getting darker or lighter with the changing conditions, shifting from category 2 to category 4.Light, yet strong Spectron 3CF polycarbonate lenses.NXT Zebra 2-4 lenses offer unrivalled clarity and an excellent strength to weight ratio.Alti Arc lenses use mineral glass for superior clarity and an excellent strength to weight ratio.Anti-reflective coating on Alti Arc lenses block infrared and remove stray reflections and glare.Category 4 lenses transmit only 3-8% of visible light. Great for glaciers, but too dark for driving or everyday wear.Flash lens coatings increase contrast.Removeable, soft-touch fabric side shields provide an extra line of defence against harsh reflected light.Rubberized temples and nose bridge pads help keep the glasses where you want them.Contoured temples offer a snug, yet comfortable fit.Included retention cord adds a bit of protection for your glasses.",
