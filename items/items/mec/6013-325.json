  "description": "With its iconic styling, an Opinel knife is instantly recognizable, from the ergonomic handle, to the intuitive locking mechanism, there is a reason these knives are classics.Carbon steel blade holds a keen edge. (Note that the carbon content will lead to corrosion if the blade is not occasionally oiled and sharpened.)Virobloc double safety ring prevents accidental closure.Natural varnished beech handle fits comfortably in the hand and minimizes the chance of blisters.Synthetic leather sheath keeps the knife close to hand.",
