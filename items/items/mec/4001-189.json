  "description": "Long the standard-issue protection for cameras, radios, and other delicate equipment. Canoeists and kayakers love Pelican Cases for keeping cameras easily accessible, yet utterly safe and secure. Because they are fully watertight they are also airtight. The larger cases have a finger-operated purge valve so after flying or climbing you can equalize the interior air pressure to make them easier to open.Made of lightweight structural foam resin that won\u2019t dent, crack, or corrode. Light enough to float in salt water with a load up to 5.6kg.Sturdy gasket around the rim makes them watertight.Removable pick-n-pluck foam is perforated into cubes, so you can customize the size and shape of inner compartment.Both the Pelican warranty and MEC's Rocksolid Guarantee cover this case itself. Neither guarantee covers the contents you put inside the case.",
