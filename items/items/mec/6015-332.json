With just a few hours of sun a day, the Enduro runs 3 days or more with everything turned on, or over 3 months in expedition GPS mode. Get day-to-day metrics for training runs and workouts, plus smartwatch and activity tracking functions. The free Connect app pairs your phone to your watch, to download training plans, review activities, receive texts, social media alerts and emails, track the weather and more.Power Glass solar panel extends charge time: from 80 hours to 95 days depending on features used.Sun gauge displays solar charge status.Built-in modes for running \u2013 ultra-specific mode features rest timers, biking, swimming (indoor and out), multisport, gym (strength training, cardio and elliptical, stair stepping, rowing and yoga), golfing (42,000+ courses downloadable), skiing and more.Updated ClimbPro\u2122 gives stats on ascents and descents, showing the grade, length, totals and current position on an elevation profile (for preloaded courses).PacePro\u2122, set your course and desired pace, then compare it to your distance splits, the Enduro compares your needed pace vs your goal pace for each split and for the course.Body Battery\u2122 tracks daily energy levels, monitoring what drains your energy (exercise) and recharges your energy (rest, food), letting you train smarter.Strava Segment integration, preloaded and on-the-fly (through your phone), lets you know when starred segments begin and shows instantaneous data, comparing it to your PR and the current KOM or QOM, and provides results once complete. (requires Strava premium)Mountain biking dynamics distance and speed, grit: overall trail difficulty, and flow: a score of how smoothly you rode the trail.Breadcrumb trails track your trek, navigate you to a saved location or entered coordinate (there are no maps for routing), or navigate you on the trail you took back to where you started.Garmin Pay\u2122, make payments with your watch (if supported by your bank).LiveTrack, share your location and fitness data during activities (through a phone).Connects to 3 satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS and Galileo) and caches satellite positions.Elevate\u2122 V3 optical heart rate monitor has a red LED for Pulse Ox data and even works while swimming.Physiological data: VO2 max \u2013 focused on trail and ultra running, a race predictor, recovery advisor with an ultra running mode and performance indicator \u2013 many take temperature and altitude into consideration.7-day training load lets you know if you're overtraining, under-training, or on the right path.Compatible with running dynamics sensors (sold separately).Incident detection + assistance mode sends out a LiveTrack link letting your contacts know where you are.24/7 activity tracking learns your activity level and guides you towards a more active lifestyle.Sleep tracking shows total sleep hours as well as movement and restful sleep.Customizable display lets you have activity specific screens with 1 to 8 data fields per screen.Connect IQ to download apps, widgets, templates and data fields.UltraTrac\u2122 mode reduces the GPS communication to save battery.Pre-set and custom power profiles let you maximize your battery\u2019s power.ABC data comes in via the internal altimeter, barometer and a tilt-compensated compass.User-friendly strap changes (compatible with 26mm QuickFit\u2122 bands).In the box: Enduro, charging cable and documentation.",
