  "description": "Even when you do keep the open side up, in big water a tandem canoe can flood pretty fast. Help keep it buoyant with these heavy-duty end bags. Pair them with a centre bag for maximum safety.Heavy polyurethane-coated nylon is resistant to abrasion and UV.Large dump valve allows quick inflation and deflation.Cut wider at the middle than the ends to conform to most canoes.Fits most whitewater tandem canoes except those with built-in flotation chambers.Dimensions are 75 x 72 x 46cm (length, width, depth) or 29\u00bd x 28\u00bd x 18in.",
