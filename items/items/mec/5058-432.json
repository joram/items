  "description": "The waterproof Sea-Light mounts securely to flatter kayak decks or solid canoe seats. Its suction-cupped sleeve makes it easy to remove during the day, or to transfer it to other boats. The dome at the top beams light in a 360-degree ring when the unit is vertical, making nighttime paddlers visible to other boats from all directions. If you mount the Sea-Light behind you to avoid compromising your night vision, use a headlamp or other forward-facing light to fill in the gap where the Sea-Light is masked by your body.Waterproof light tested for 24hrs at 1m (3.3 ft.).Domed lens provides a half-sphere of light, offering enhanced visibility over previous models.Operational Life of more than 30 hours at 30\u00b0C (more than 20 hours at -1\u00b0C).Moisture sensor activates the light automatically when wet (this can be overridden). There is also twist on/off for manual operation.20 lumen LED requires 2 AA batteries (not included).Safety leash secures the light to a PFD.USCG/SOLAS, CE and Transport Canada certified.C-Light\u2122 can be removed for use on life jackets, packs, etc.Suction cup offers great non-permanent deck lighting solution.",
