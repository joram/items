  "description": "What's not to love here? The Teca Calido Jacket is reversible, adds warmth, sheds rain and reroutes fabric that was destined for the landfill \u2013 so it can go climbing, peak bagging or hiking.Reversible design offers styling options.Fabric has a DWR finish and 600mm polyurethane backing to keep out light rain and wind.Elasticised piping at the hood cuff and hem help keep chill winds out.Packs into its own internal chest pocket.Plenty of pocket space on both sides.Insulated with 100% recycled polyester insulation.Cotopaxi designates 1% of their revenue to provide grants for non-profits.Made with available repurposed polyester remnant fabric, making each color is limited edition.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
