  "description": "Based on a popular design that works well for climbers, canyoneers, and cavers, the Boreo blends excellent protection with durability. The shell combines hard plastic and light, dense foam to absorb impact either from contact with the rock or from falling stones and ice chunks. This model also offers side impact protection that comes into play if you get flipped upside down in a lead fall or punch through an unstable snow bridge.Injection moulded ABS shell is lightweight and durable.Expanded polystyrene and polypropylene liner absorbs impacts from above as well as all sides.Comfort foam is quilted and lined with absorbent fabric that's washable.Precise headband adjustment with two push-buttons and Y-shaped webbing straps that can be adjusted around your ears.Headband folds into the shell for storage and transport.Headlamp attachment uses 4 sensibly placed clips.Compatible with Petzl\u00ae Vizion face shield.",
