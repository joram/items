  "description": "An innovative update on the classic French press. This double-walled mug has an inner mug that serves as the plunger. Once pushed down, the inner mug creates a tight seal and brews your java, allowing you to hit the road without removing parts or pouring into a new container.Double walls and nylon sleeve provide 3 layers of insulation.Flip-top lid seals in heat, prevents sloshing, and unscrews easily to stir in cream and sugar.Non-slip foot keeps the mug upright.Slim profile fits cup holders and bottle pockets on packs.",
