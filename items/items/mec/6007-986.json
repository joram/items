  "description": "A triple threat, rated for use as a half, twin or single rope. This super-light option is great as a twin or half rope for alpine excursions and winter sends. Use it as a skinny single for your next-level redpoints, when every gram matters.Dry treatment on both sheath and core protects against water and dirt.Coated yarns allow individual fibres to glide over each other, reducing internal friction and fully utilizing each yarn when loaded, for extra durability.Comes lap-coiled by the factory, so ready to climb.High sheath percentage increases durability.Specs shown are for use as a single rope.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
