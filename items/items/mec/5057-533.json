  "description": "When hard water bottles are too heavy and bulky, reach for the Stow. This pared-down, minimalist water bottle holds 500ml of your favourite hydrating drink. When you're finished, the soft TPU body packs down to nearly nothing. Stretch the bail handle around the rolled-up bottle to keep it nice and small while you tuck it away in your pack or running vest. Durable construction and RF-welded seams stand up to long days on the move.RF welded to create superior bonds.BPA-free, PVC-free and meets or exceeds FDA and EU regulations.Excellent puncture resistance.Collapses down for easy packing.Spillproof nozzle is easy to drink from when on the move.28mm opening makes quick work of filling and cleaning.Internal baffle gives the bottle some structure, and gives you something to hold onto.Soft bail handle is comfy to carry and doubles as a retention loop when the bottle is rolled up.80% lighter than the average water bottle of the same volume.",
