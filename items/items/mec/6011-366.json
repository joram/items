  "description": "Stacked, like your favourite multi-tool. The Pagoda Tour 112 is built for dedicated backcountry skiers, and has the versatility to float, grip and climb. Carbon laminate is incredibly light and creates moderate damping with solid power and bite, and the wood and foam core gives you stability and float while keeping your turns playful.Carbon sandwich construction is light, torsionally stiff, strong and powerful.Improved dampness and smoothness makes the ski ask for more speed even when the conditions gets choppy.Layered ash and paulownia wood and foam core for power, energy and dampness.Textured nylon top sheet is snowphobic.RP sidecut is tapered, with flatter sections that blend at the contact points to make it a smooth, smooth driver.Wide profile Rockwell 48 steel edges provide excellent edge control without sacrificing a playful, floaty ride.World Cup Race base is fast and hard for exceptional performance.",
