  "description": "Sometimes less is more. The Barely Baggies Shorts have less material and more comfort than the standard Baggies. Just like the popular longer version, they're at home in hot climates and around (on in) the water. Lightweight, yet durable, the nylon fabric makes them quick to dry and easy to pack.DWR finish helps them dry quickly and shrug off dirt and spills.Mesh pockets drain quickly and stash a few items.Internal key pocket.Slim fit with a low-rise provides a flattering, youthful silhouette.Inner drawcord lets you cinch in the perfect fit.",
