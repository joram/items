  "description": "A triple threat line that's dry treated and certified as a single half and twin. For sporty routes and hard redpoints, it's now leaner, meaner and more versatile than before.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.XPDry dry coating is certified to the UIAA Water Repellent standard of less than 5% water absorption. It protects the rope from water absorption, which reduces weight, prevents freezing, and slows down the wear on the sheath to a noticeable degree.Specs shown are for use as a single rope.When used as a half rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands):\nDynamic elongation: 27.6%\nStatic elongation: 7%\nImpact force: 6.6kN\nUIAA fall rating: 15When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands):\nDynamic elongation: 25.3%\nStatic elongation: 3.6%\nImpact force: 10.4kN\nUIAA fall rating: 20",
