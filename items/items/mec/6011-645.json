The moderate taper and strong multi-layer wood core offer stability and good power transfer on groomers or the rough stuff. Titanal reduces chatter when you leave the drift for hardpack. Overall, the Kendo is a sporty freeride ski, ready to ride wherever you are.Multi-layer wood core puts strong beech wood under the binding and lighter poplar everywhere else.Carbon layup in the tips increase reliability and stability.Vertical sidewalls offer grip, stability and sensitivity.Titanal layer adds significant damping to reduce chatter on firm terrain.Combination tip and tail rocker make it turn-friendly and allow for a stiffer flex set-up.3 radius sidecut makes turn initiation easy of different terrains.P-Tex 2100 base gives exceptional glide.Recommended for use with Marker Royal bindings.",
