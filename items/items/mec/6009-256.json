  "description": "A light race-day shoe built to handle mid-ultra distance races and moderately technical trails. The midsole offers a soft landing at the heel, and support that gets firmer as you roll through your stride. For a Hoka shoe, the Torrent is relatively stripped down and speedy, but you still get the forgiving landing characteristic of all Hokas.Breathable engineered mesh upper is made from Repreve\u00ae recycled plastic.Protective overlays on toe and forefoot increase protection from trail debris.Dual-density Profly\u2122 midsole balances cushion and responsiveness.Sticky rubber outsole has multi-directional lugs for reliable traction.",

    "Heel-to-toe cushioning\n\nThe approximate thickness of the midsole cushioning under the heel and the forefoot. A thicker heel and greater difference between heel and toe height tends to suit heel-strike runners, while forefoot and midfoot strikers may prefer a minimal drop between heel and toe cushioning.": [
