  "description": "The Boa is a good rope for universal use. It's adequately beefy for sport climbing and top roping, but skinny and supple so you won't mind carrying it to the furthest route from the parking lot. The dry treatment meets the UIAA water repellent standards, absorbing less than 2% of it's weight when wet.Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating.Pro Dry finish makes this rope durably water repellent and dirt resistant.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product",
