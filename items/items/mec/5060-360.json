  "description": "A spacious tent for those who won't compromise on liveability in the backcountry. Building on the well-loved Volt series, we've amped up the interior volume with vertical walls and a living space that can accommodate wide sleeping pads. Its lightweight design doesn't weigh down your pack, and there's plenty of room to hang out in at night or during storms.Polyester ripstop fly is UV-resistant and stretches less than nylon when wet.Lightweight nylon and mesh canopy balance weather protection and ventilation.Fully seam taped.DriBase\u2122 waterproof floor offers durable water protection throughout the lifetime of the tent.Peaked vents in the fly.DAC poles have pressfit connectors and a high strength-to-weight ratio.Hubbed pole design creates steep walls for greater internal volume.Reflective zipper pulls and stake-out cords.4 interior mesh pockets.Includes 12 aluminum stakes, guylines and stuff sack.Optional footprint available for floor protection or an ultralight fly-and-footprint configuration (sold separately).",
