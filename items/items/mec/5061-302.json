  "description": "Discover the best places in Ontario to connect with the natural world. This guide explores the remarkable splendour and diversity of the province, from its soaring clifftops, subterranean caves and thundering cataracts, to the province's tallest white pine, the oldest rocks on Earth and the warbler capital of North America. Organized by region, 110 Nature Hot Spots in Ontario includes maps that showcase each area's locations of interest. Each destination includes a descriptive profile illustrated with colour photographs and at-a-glance information about special features and contact details. The book is an essential companion for naturalists, budding botanists and biologists, photographers, hikers, campers and paddlers.",
