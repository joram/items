  "description": "All-mountain skis that handle whatever conditions the snow throws at you. These versatile skis combine a lightweight and damping core and a longer turn radius for a ski that's fun and powerful, like a frontside ski, that's light enough for touring.Carbon sandwich construction is light, torsionally stiff, strong and powerful.Improved dampness and smoothness makes the ski ask for more speed even when the conditions gets choppy.Layered ash and paulownia wood and foam core for power, energy and dampness.Textured nylon top sheet is snowphobic.C2 sidecut is tapered, with flatter sections that blend for performance in any snow condition.Wide profile Rockwell 48 steel edges provide excellent edge control without sacrificing a playful, floaty ride.World Cup Race base is fast and hard for exceptional performance.",
