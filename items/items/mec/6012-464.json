  "description": "Thicker and warmer than ever before, the updated Trail Pro will have you dreaming sweetly all-year round. The secret to 4-season comfort is the unique StrataCore\u2122 construction that combines ridges of thermal foam with layers of air. And, the WingLock\u2122 valve makes inflating your pad easier than ever.WingLock valve uses 1-way airflow to inflate quickly and easily. To deflate, simply twist the wings and open the valve. Simple to use even while wearing gloves.Inflates and deflates 3x faster than Therm-a-Rest\u2019s classic valve.StrataCore construction uses a continuous layer of thermal foam nestled between alternating ridges of air and foam to save weight but preserve the durability of a self-inflating pad.Expanding, self-inflating foam core self-inflates. Add a few breathes of air for personalized firmness.Self-inflating foam is durable and reliable compared to air only pads.",
