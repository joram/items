  "description": "This solidly constructed pump lets you empty a flooded kayak much faster than a scoop bailer would. If you are rafted up with another kayak or stabilized with a paddlefloat, the pump can also be thrust down the waist tunnel of your fastened sprayskirt, allowing you to pump out the cockpit without it being constantly reflooded by incoming waves.Conspicuously coloured foam collar keeps the pump from sinking and floats it in an upright position.Solid brass piston rod for strength and durability.Large handle allows easy operation, even with gloves on.Easily disassembled for cleaning.",
