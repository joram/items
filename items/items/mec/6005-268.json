  "description": "The Tarantulas will help you stick to routes with the tenacity of an 8-legged bug. They suit all around climbers on varied terrain and really excel at gym climbing and single-pitch cragging. The closure can be set at a wide range of so they should fit various foot shapes.Unlined leather uppers are comfortable for all-day cragging and long hours in the gym.Slightly asymmetric shape balances comfort and performance.Long lasting sticky FriXion\u00ae rubber sticks to plastic and rock equally well.La Sportiva suggests downsizing 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from your street shoe size.",
