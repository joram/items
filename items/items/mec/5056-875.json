  "description": "Great for ascending a fixed rope. The shunt is essentially a mechanical prusik. Releasing it forces the internal cam to grab the rope. Hold the cam open with your rope-free hand (much like guiding a prusik) to descend.Use with 10-11mm single ropes, or 8-11mm double ropes of equal diameter.CE and UIAA approved.",
