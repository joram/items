  "description": "Keep your fingers strong, no matter your training space. The Prime Rib hangboard's slim design is less than 11cm tall, so it can easily be mounted above your door frame or almost anywhere. Wood construction is super skin-friendly, so you can put in hours (let's be honest - minutes) of hanging without getting raw tips.Made of fine-grain wood that doesn't shred your skin.3 different sized edges work for all ability levels.4 screws included for mounting.",
