  "description": "The East Kootenay region, tucked in the mountainous southeast corner of BC, is excellent hiking territory. Browse through this guidebook to find routes, trails and roads around Cranbrook, Kimberley, Creston, Invermere, Radium and Fernie. Some of the provincial parks covered are Akamina-Kishinena, Top of the World, Elk Lakes, St. Mary\u2019s Alpine, Bugaboo and Glacier. Mountain Footsteps, 4th Edition, includes detailed descriptions, colour maps and photos. New to this edition is basic information on established bike trails for hikers who are also interested in recreational cycling. As well, there is an entirely new selection of day hikes in the northern Purcells and a number of short hikes and walks in the lower elevations of the East Kootenay.",
