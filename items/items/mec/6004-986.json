  "description": "Trail rubber experts WTB designed the Byway 650B to be a \"60% trail, 40% road\" tire, making it ideal for rides that start on tarmac before hitting sweet, sweet gravel roads. The smooth centre tread rolls like a road tire on asphalt, with the high volume adding extra comfort. Once you hit the rough stuff, diamond-shaped outer knobs start to engage for traction and handling. The Byway is easy to set up tubeless, allowing you to take advantage of the light weight and decreased rolling resistance that tubeless offers.Tubeless-ready.High volume and smooth centerline tread means a fast, comfortable ride on paved surfaces.Diamond-shaped outer knobs provide some bite in the dirt.Tan sidewalls add a retro touch.",
