  "description": "For cheery campsite light and a surprising amount of heat, turn to the reliable candle lantern. When packed, it telescopes shut with the candle inside. In camp, it opens to hang from its chain and hook.Body is made of lightweight aluminum, globe is made of glass.Unique spring-loaded candle tube keeps the flame height constant, while a small viewing window shows the remaining candle life.UCO candles burn clean for about 9 hours and resist hot weather meltdown.To clean candle wax from the inside, put your lantern in the freezer. Frozen wax will chip off easily.",
