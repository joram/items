  "description": "We've probably said this before, but the Alpine Ally layers really are a champagne product on a PBR budget. The 3-layer nylon offers the performance of well-known fabrics, but the raw material costs considerably less. They have a full set of backcountry-worthy features: contoured waistband and a fly, shockcord at the hems and taped seams to keep them waterproof. Cut to slide over hiking or mountaineering boots (but too slim for most ski boots) they are robust enough for all-mountain adventures from trailhead to summit.3-layer 70-denier nylon fabric has a waterproof breathable laminate and a DWR finish and is fully seam taped for full waterproof protection.Contoured waistband has belt loops and a zippered fly.Zippered thigh pocket has an expanding side gusset, a key hook and a storm flap to keep rain out.3/4 length side zippers have two sliders at the top for venting options and one at the bottom for eay on/off over mountaineering or hiking boots.Knee articulation darts increase your range of motion.Reinforced kick patches are made with polyester and Kevlar for great abrasion resistance.Snap adjustable cuffs have a boot lace hook and grommets for adding your own instep cord.Recco\u00ae Rescue System reflector is detectable by ski patrol and rescue teams. Useful for resort skiing, it is not a substitute for skills training, beacons, or smart decision-making in the backcountry.\n\nRegular fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nOur next to skin fit that contours the body for no distractions\n\n\n\n\n\nOur close to body fit with a low profile silhouette for ease of movement\n\n\n\n\n\nOur standard, slightly off body fit for unrestricted comfort\n\n\n\n\n\nOur roomy, off body fit for maximum comfort and easy layering\n\n\n\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",

    "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.  Values under 8,000g/m2/24h provide low performance, 20,000g/m2/24h provide moderate performance and values over 30,000g/m2/24h provide high performance.": [

    "Fabric waterproof rating\n\nThe standard test for waterproof fabrics uses a standing column filled with water.  The figures given are the water column height.  A rating of 3,500mm or higher can be considered waterproof.  The higher the rating, the more durable the waterproof fabric will be over time.": [

A wind-resistant garment resists some wind, but not as much as a garment that is windproof.": [
