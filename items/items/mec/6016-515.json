  "description": "Tucked in a streamlined case, the 9 Peak has full multisport GPS functions. For urban runs and races, the Snap-to-Route feature offer precision that's great for training or races that wind through canyons of glass and steel, or feature that interfere with GPS signals. Intelligent power management software tracks battery status. On the fly mode changes give you enough power for the last kilometer or the next 50. With more than 80 activity profiles, the 9-series is ready for your next run, or your next game of jai alai. The optical heart rate monitor adds precision to your training. Paired with a compatible phone running the Suunto app and the 9-series app, you can interact with other fitness apps, transfer activities, receive notifications (calls, texts, reminders, etc.), plan routes using heatmaps, share activities and more. Activity tracking features record steps and calories, as well as monitor the quality of your sleep. This 24/7 performance is all part of calculating your recovery times and tracking your progress.Snap-to-Route matches your GPS track to a preloaded route (aka a .GPX file), removing inaccurate GPS points that lead to inaccurate data. Go past the 100m buffer, and your route is plotted by GPS, not by preloaded route. Within 20m of your planned route, it tracks the planned route.LifeQ\u2019s optical heart rate monitor provides blood oxygen level information plus reliable constant heart rate data without a chest strap.Heatmaps display other Suunto user\u2019s activities over local maps, making it easy to find the best runs, rides, trails, or swims.FusedTrack\u2122 uses data from the internal sensors to plot your route between GPS points. By combining the data, you get a track that mirrors your actual track, while only checking into GPS once or twice a minute, greatly increasing battery life: 25-170h with GPS recording.FusedSpeed\u2122 combines GPS and accelerometer data to provide a more stable running pace.Pre-set intelligent battery profiles change modes to get specific runtimes and features out of the remaining battery.Custom battery profiles allow you to set-up exactly what you need for an activity. Saving these modes lets you have specific battery profiles for different activities.Low battery detection mode switches off everything but the activity timer.Free Suunto app lets you connect and sync to your favourite training apps, like Strava\u00ae, Training Peaks\u00ae and Komoot\u00ae.Suunto app enables sharing metrics with coaches and personal trainers, opening up a whole world of digital training plans and tips.Loaded with more than 80 different sport modes, from running, swimming, cycling and many more, there is a sport specific mode for nearly every activity.GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and QZSS satellite constellation support for strong signal anywhere.24/7 activity tracking, learning your activity level and guiding you towards a more active lifestyle.Sleep tracking monitors the quality of your sleep, when you turn in and total sleep, using this data to calculate recovery times and progress.Tilt compensated digital compass.Barometric altimeter tracks ascents, descents and total elevation changes.Altitude acclimation calculated through altitude data and blood oxygenation data.Storm alarm tracks pressure changes.Ambient light sensor adjusts screen backlight to match conditions.Bluetooth Smart connects fitness sensors from power meters to foot pods, plus phones.Automatically syncs data to paired phones running free Suunto app.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) via Bluetooth.Free software updates via Bluetooth, add functionality and improve performance.Virtually scratchproof sapphire crystal face and stainless steel hardware.Fast-charging USB power cord can charge from 0-100% in 1 hour (when paired with fast-charging USB port).Charging cable attaches to the watch with magnets.User-friendly strap changes, thanks to quick-release pins. Fits any 22mm wide strap.Fits wrists 12.5-17.5cm.Suunto app grants access to Suunto Value Pack: premium access to popular training apps including: 60-day Strava Summit trial, 30-day Training Peaks premium membership, 3-months of Relive club and 90-day SportTracks membership.In the box: Suunto 9 Peak, USB cable and documentation.",
