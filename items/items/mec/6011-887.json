  "description": "A good knife is as useful at sea as it is on land. But most knives have one significant flaw: they sink. Maintaining the classic styling and ergonomic design that Mora is known for, the Mora Floating Knife solves the buoyancy issue with a natural cork handle that not only floats, but provides a sure, comfortable grip in wet or dry conditions.Natural cork handle is soft, grippy and floats.Scandi ground blade is great for a variety of outdoor tasks.Rigid high-visibility sheath is easy to find in low light.Sheath has an easy-to-use clip system that allows you to mount your knife almost anywhere.",
