The 2.5 layers shell fabric is incredibly durable and both the  membrane and water-repellent are free from harmful fluorocarbons. Performance does not have to come at the cost of environmental impact. The Atmos\u2122 waterproof membrane is hydrophilic, not micro-porous, meaning breathability won't be compromised when the jacket gets dirty.Mission Hardshell\u2122 ripstop polyester has 70% recycled content.Atmos\u2122 waterproof-breathable membrane repels moisture.Fluorocarbon-free DWR finish keep wetness from seeping in.Adjustable hood provides visibility in bad conditions.Side pockets and big inner pocketHidden elastic in cuff closures seal out the elements.Pleated hem for movement.Should the jacket wear out after years of use, it can be returned to Houdini for recycling.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
