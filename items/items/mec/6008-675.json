As part of Big Agnes\u2019 System line, it has an integrated sleeve to holds your pad snug against your bag.Shell is lightweight ripstop nylon with a water-repellent finish. Lining is soft polyester cotton blend.FireLine\u2122 Max insulation is 50% recycled polyester. Multi-denier polyester insulation blends hollow and solid fibres to maximize comfort, loft and warmth.Double zippers let you enter from either side, or completely unzip the top for use as a comforter.Top can be zipped together with a separately available Park Bag Wedgie to create a mummy bag.Insulated draft tube along the hood.Integrated sleeping pad sleeve has side stretch panels to fit pads from 64\u201376 x 198cm.YKK #8 anti-snag zipper for a smooth, quick zip.Zips together with other Park series bags.Free Range Hood is cinchable with 1 hand and lets you lift and move your head.Built-in pocket keeps a pillow in place through the night.Internal phone pocket.Interior loops for attaching a bag liner.Hang loops let you air it out in the sun.Includes a mesh storage bag and a nylon stuff sack.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
