  "description": "This 12.7-millimetre (half-inch) webbing is very malleable and has a small diameter -- so it\u2019s perfect for a tie-off on aid pieces and pins. It is not as strong as runner strength webbing and is intended only for holding progression, not falls.This product is sold by the metre.Tensile strength is 450kg.",
