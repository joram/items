  "description": "What's about the size of a beer can but weighs half as much? The NeoAir UberLite is the smallest, lightest insulated sleeping pad ever. Crazy-light  fabric and internal reflective film shave grams. It inflates to 6.4cm of sleeping comfort but packs down small enough to delight the ultralight crowd.Ultralight 15-denier high-tenacity nylon.WingLock valve with 1-way airflow inflates 3 times faster than conventional valves and is simple to use even with gloves on.To deflate, simply twist the wing valve to open.Triangle core matrix is stable and has a heat-trapping reflective film.Air-only pads have no insulation that can be compromised by moisture, often added when you inflate them by mouth.Includes a pump sack, stuff sack and repair kit.",
