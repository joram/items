  "description": "Full coverage and warmth for small skiers and riders who want to play outside in wind or wet snow (because wet snow is the best building snow). This classic one-piece suit offers warmth and weather protection when there's fun to be had in fall and winter. Redesigned for 2018 based on member feedback, the Toaster Suit is now waterproof and tougher than ever. Durable waterproof fabric helps them stay warm and dry through hours in the snow, and it's abrasion-resistant to stand up to the demands of serious play. The suit has room for layers and a hem that can be let down to accommodate growth, then (if you need it) tacked up again to ready it for the next kid in line.Shell is abrasion-resistant 150-denier 2-layer polyester with a polyurethane waterproof-breathable laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish. Seams are not taped, so this garment will not be fully waterproof in heavy rain.Reinforced knee, rear and scuff guard is 400-denier nylon with a polyurethane waterproof-breathable laminate and DWR. Updated based on member feedback, this fabric has higher tear and abrasion resistance.Lining is recycled polyester.Insulated with 300g MEC Hyperloft, with 240g in the sleeves and hood for freedom of movement.Attached hood is toggle-free for safety and has an internal elastic to seal in heat.Interior fleece-lined collar provides warmth and comfort, and the fold-over chin guard prevents chafing.Elasticized cuffs with internal storm cuff to keep out the cold and snow.Dual front zips allow easy on/off and have external weather flaps.Side cargo pocket closes with a flap and snap and has a ski pass loop inside.Reflective piping across arms and hood. Patch on arm has reflective embroidery for heightened visibility.Articulated knees.Reinforced knees and ankle cuffs provide added durability.Internal gaiters have grip elastic to cinch around boots to keep out snow.Grow hem system lets you undo a line of stitching at the ankle to add extra length to accommodate growth spurts.Durable MEC zipper pulls.Hand-me-down ID label.The Toaster Bunting Suit (5037-265) is the comparable suit for sizes 2T and smaller.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
