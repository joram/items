  "description": "Convert your MSR Zoic 3-Person Tent to a minimalist shelter for speedy ultralight missions. Leave the regular mesh tent body and footprint at home and swap in the Fast & Light Tent body instead. It's a beefed up footprint that features a bathtub style floor to guard against wind and rain splatter for more protection than a simple footprint and rainfly set up.Set up is easy: simply stake out the Fast & Light Body, insert the poles, clip the body to the poles, then attach the fly over top.Poles and fly not included. This Fast & Light Body is designed to be used with your current MSR Zoic 3-Person Tent setup.",
