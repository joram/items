  "description": "Torque Nuts fits well in standard crack placements, but they have the extra advantage of camming into position if you place them in a horizontal. They work in straight-sided cracks, and are way lighter than a full rack of big-crack cams. Doubled slings allow them to ride high when they are racked, but reduce drag when extended.Aluminum alloy dead and sling are colour-coded.Recessed heads prevent abrasion of the sling.Dyneema bartack is shrink wrapped for extra protection.Tapered shape provides a wide range of placement options.",
