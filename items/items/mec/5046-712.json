  "description": "The Boa is a good rope for universal use. It's adequately beefy for sport climbing and top roping, but skinny and supple so you won't mind carrying it in to the furthest route from the parking lot.Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating.3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product",
