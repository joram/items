  "description": "The lightest keylock locking carabiner in the world (circa spring 2010). They're light, so you can bring some extras. For the size, this carabiner has strong open gate and cross-load breaking strength. The tradeoff is overall strength and durability, which won\u2019t be as great over the life of the carabiner.I-beam construction gives it a very impressive gate-face test of 4kN. This test pushes the gate face inward while locked.Constructed from hot-forged aluminum.",
