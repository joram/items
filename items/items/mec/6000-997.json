  "description": "Few things feel as good as little bit of warmth on a cold day, and these little handwarmers are like your own personal heater. They slip easily into gloves, pockets, and anywhere else you need a little heat. No fumes, no flames and no batteries required.Sold in pairs. Each handwarmer is sealed in its own airtight pocket.Activated by contact with the air (oxidization). Process can be paused by putting the handwarmer in any airtight container \u2013 but it needs to be used within a few days.Each handwarmer provides more than 7 hours of heat.Made from natural ingredients, meaning you can easily dispose of them in any regular garbage.Ingredients include: iron powder, water, salt, activated charcoal and vermiculite.",
