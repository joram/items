  "description": "The Ultra Lite is actually only a pulley sheave, so you'll need an oval carabiner to create the axle upon which it operates. It's a great minimalist design for mountaineers or climbers hauling small packs. However, it is not for use on Tyrolean traverses or organized rescue.Requires a round stock, oval locking carabiner.Breaking strength of 16kN, working load of 1kN.For ropes up to 13mm.For personal emergency use only.",
