  "description": "Rope drag sucks. A Rabbit Runner lets you extend placements on wandering pitches or sling horns and icicles with ease. A smaller loop at one end securely holds a carabiner and a wider loop at the other lets you girth-hitch when the situation calls for it. Toss on a second carabiner to create multiple length options.Made of light and abrasion-resistant 13mm Dynex.Sewn loops at each end give you different set-up options.",
