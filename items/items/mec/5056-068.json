  "description": "A favourite all-around performer for many female climbers, the Miura is designed to perform well on mixed terrain, from smaller features on vertical to overhanging routes. Its asymmetrical shape, superbly tensioned rands and down-cambered, curved last provide great power for edging. The down-lasted toe and power hinge under the arch help the Miura flex and grab small footholds.Made of suede leather with a full sewn-in 8-panel Dentex lining to limit stretch.1.1mm Laspoflex midsole in the toebox supports your foot to help reduce foot fatigue.Speed lace system pulls tight easily and cinches your foot for a great fit.Padded heel and tongue add a bit of comfort.4mm Vibram\u00ae XS Grip2\u2122 soles offer excellent grip.La Sportiva suggests downsizing 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from your street shoe size.",
