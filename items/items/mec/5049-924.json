  "description": "The Red River Gorge in eastern Kentucky is one of the best rock-climbing areas in the world. Its solid, well-featured sandstone makes for steep, spectacular climbing, with almost 2000 established routes, from traditionally protected cracks to some of the hardest sport climbs in the US. Volume 1 covers the northern half of the Red River Gorge (cliffs north of Miguel's Pizza and the Mountain Parkway). Most cliffs in this region lie on Forest Service land, including popular areas like Military Wall, Left Flank, Long Wall, and Funk Rock City.",
