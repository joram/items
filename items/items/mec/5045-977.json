  "description": "Looking for a 2-burner camp stove that can fit into a cooking pot? Until the Genesis 2, this was an impossible ask. With a unique folding hinge (sort of like a waffle maker) it can be stashed in a small space in the back of the car or in the rooftop box. It features 2 powerful burners to satisfy even the most demanding backcountry chef du cuisine. As efficient as it is powerful, it can boil 48L of water with a 1lb. propane bottle.2 burners each rated at 10,000BTUs.Simmer controls.Piezo ignition.JetLink port is compatible with additional Genesis cooking systems.Compact design fits inside the Genesis 5L Flux Pot (not included).Carry bag and fuel regulator included.",
