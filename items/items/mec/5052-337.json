  "description": "Like the Grigri 2 but beefier for use with fat single ropes and to hold up to lots of use. Great for those learning to climb and belay, it offers a very controlled descent and has an anti-panic handle to stops the descent if the user pulls too hard. A stainless steel protector plate makes it durable, and a wide space between the cam and body reduces wear with heavily used or furred ropes.Anti-panic handle brakes and stops the descent if the user pulls too hard on the handle.Special mode for taking slack, that also provides a comfortable top-rope belay.Aluminum side plates, stainless steel friction plate and wear plate, and reinforced nylon lowering handle for durability.Recommended for use with 8.9 \u2013 10.5mm diameter single ropes, but can also be used with ropes down to 8.5mm and up to 11mm.CE and EN certified.",
