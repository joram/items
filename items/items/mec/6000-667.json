  "description": "Extend their surf season in a full-body wetsuit. 3mm neoprene is a welcome layer when it\u2019s nice enough to swim but too cold for just a swimsuit. Flatlock seams eliminate chafing and won\u2019t impede their strokes when they\u2019re out catching waves.3mm neoprene provides warmth on days when a swimsuit won't cut it.Xcel neoprene uses earth-mined limestone in place of petrochemicals, reducing carbon footprint by 200g of CO emissions per wetsuit.Back zipper for easy on and off.Durable flatlock seams lie flat on skin for a comfortable fit.Xcel recommends this suit for water temperatures between 13 and 18\u00b0C.",
