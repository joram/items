  "description": "At only a little longer than a single AA battery, the E18R fits easily into your EDC. And once you have a good compact flashlight, you'll wonder how you lived without it. Equipped with 5 different modes that take you from getting up in the night without disturbing anyone, all the way to a darkness-defying 750 lumens, the E18R has your brightness bases covered. A magnetic USB charging clip and a magnetic tail cap offer easy charging and hands-free lighting. The deep-carry clip drops the light safely in your pocket and doubles as a mechanical lockout.5 lighting modes: 5 lumens (70h), 30 lumens (13.8h), 150 lumens (2.5h), 750 lumen turbo (0.75h \u2013 only useable for a few minutes at a time due to heat buildup) and a 750 lumen strobe.Deep-carry pocket clip rotates to cover the switch, providing an easy-to-use mechanical lock-out.Precision-engineered optical lens provides a mix of flood and spot lighting.Magnetic tail cap lets you attach your light to metal surfaces for hands-free lighting.USB-powered magnetic charging clip attaches easily to the light and doesn\u2019t compromise waterproofness.Works with 1 rechargeable 16340 battery (included) or 1 CR123A battery \u2013 power options are a big plus when travelling.LED power indicator on the side-mounted switch lets you know how your battery is doing when charging and discharging.Rugged aluminum body has type-III hard anodizing for an extra level of protection.IP68 waterproofing protects your light in any conditions (although it's not built for use underwater).Regulated output maintains constant brightness throughout battery life.Compact formfactor is easy to carry. Dimensions: 6 x 2.1cm.In the box: E18R, ARB-L16-700P 16340 rechargeable battery, magnetic charging cable, lanyard, spare O-ring, key ring, pocket clip, user manual and warranty card.",
