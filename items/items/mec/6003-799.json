  "description": "Take a shine to the whole mountain. The playful QST 99 doesn't get skittish on the hardpack or bogged down in the soft stuff. An all-terrain rocker profile floats through light snow without sacrificing stability and power for the groomers. Light in the tip and tail for easy steering and agility, it adapts to changing conditions and consistently rides them out.Internally milled wood core offers great stability and rebound.Titanal insert edge-to-edge underfoot helps with power transfer and edging on hard snow.Layer of carbon and flax laminate keeps the weight low while increasing the ski's dampness.A layer of Basalt improves edge grip, energy transfer and liveliness.All-terrain rocker 2.0 offers a mix of precision and agility.Sandwich construction features ABS sidewall all around the ski for increase durability and strength.5-point sidecut improves steering in mixed snow and makes for a quick and agile ski.Koroyd tip is lightweight and reduces vibration without sacrificing control.Glossy topsheet looks sharp and won't hold snow.",
