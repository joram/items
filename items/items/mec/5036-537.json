  "description": "The smaller set gets their own Push Bike. Designed for 1-3 year olds, the Junior bike comes to the aid of younger siblings who only want to ride with the bigger kids. The bike has no pedals or training wheels, so kids have to use their legs for balance and movement. This exercise encourages quicker learning and makes the transition to a bicycle with pedals much easier because they've already honed their motor skills.Frame is made of birch plywood.Solid rubber tires.Soft padded synthetic leather seat keeps tiny tushies happy.Easy assembly kit includes wrench.Adjustable seat height from 28 to 32cm.",
