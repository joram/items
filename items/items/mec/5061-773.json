  "description": "This interactive roller combines the best qualities of rollers and direct drive smart trainers, providing the convenience, authentic feel and kinesthetic development of rollers while allowing you to access a wealth of training apps and virtual worlds like those offered by Zwift. A host of innovations make the Nero intuitive and accessible to use, even for riders new to rollers. A fold-down step makes mounting and dismounting a much more relaxing process, and parabolic rollers gently guide you back toward the centre if your wheels wander. Elite's Quick-motion technology allows the rollers to smoothly shift to absorb jerky movements, while twin 2.7kg flywheels provide an authentic \"real ride\" feel that you'll notice when jumping out of the saddle (which you'll be doing whenever you hit the hills in Zwift, thanks to gradient simulation up to 7\u00b0).Parabolic roller edges help guide your wheels back to center when they wander toward the edges.Roller surface is smooth, anti-static plastic that reduces noise and tire wear.Twin 2.7 kg flywheels provide a smooth, authentic \"on-road\" feel.Quick-motion technology allows rollers to handle imbalances and absorb jerky movements, smoothing out the ride and making it easier to ride out of the saddle.11 different adjustment positions let you find the perfect length for your wheelbase.Choose a course or a training program via the included My E-training app and resistance adjusts automatically.Trainer is compatible with interactive apps like Zwift, Trainer Road, Kinomap, Rouvy, The Sufferfest and many more.Gradient simulation up to 7\u00b0.Automatic electromagnetic resistance.Max power of 1360 watts.Speed, cadence and power can be broadcasted via ANT+ and Bluetooth smart to your bike computer or phone.FE-C and Bluetooth smart control takes care of resistance adjustments.Fold-down step takes the stress out of mounting and dismounting.Folds in half for compact storage or transport.Comes with free 12-month subscription to My E-Training software and app.",
