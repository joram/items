  "description": "A full body harness for fledgling climbers. With plenty of adjustability to grow along with the child, the new construction allows the tie-in points to move to maintain an optimal fit and positioning. It's padded throughout for comfort, and the padding helps maintain its shape, so it's easier to put on without reversing the loops or getting tangled.2 Slide Block buckles for safe and easy adjustment.Stitched ends prevent buckles from being fully opened.Additional tie-in loop at the back can be used for extra securing when ascending or descending on rough or steep terrain.Fixed leg loops are easy to put on.Works for ski instruction too.XXS fits waists from 45\u201355 cm. Max leg circumference is 37cm. XS fits 50\u201360 cm. Max leg circumference is 48cm.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
