  "description": "A guide to traversing the New Hampshire section of the Appalachian Trail. This section is considered one of the more challenging sections of the trail, with long stretches above tree line and the possibility for rapid temperature change and snow any month of the year. Despite its difficulty, the trail offers some of the most spectacular scenery in New England as it leaves the Connecticut River valley to traverse the beautifully rugged White Mountains. Each page is centered on the A.T. and overlaps with the adjacent pages so there is little chance of getting lost. A trail profile at the bottom of each page shows the distance between shelters, camping areas, and trail access points.",
