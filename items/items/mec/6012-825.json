  "description": "Skratch Labs has added a rich-cinnamony, non-chocolate option to add to their Recovery line. Their new Horchata flavour adds a probiotic to help with absorption of protein, and lactase which helps people who have issues with milk products or lactose. Skratch Labs focused on using a select few ingredients full of easy to breakdown proteins and sugars to give your body the fuel it needs.Ingredients: cane sugar, whole milk, nonfat milk, rice flour, dextrose, vanilla extract, cinnamon, lactase, salt, bacillus coagulans gbi-30 6086 (probiotic).Lactase enzyme helps to breaks down the lactose in the milk. So, if you\u2019re lactose intolerant, let the mixed Recovery serving sit for a couple minutes before you drink it.Certified Kosher.",
