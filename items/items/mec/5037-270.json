  "description": "The comfort of the youngest members of your tribe can make or break a family\u2019s winter trip. As its name implies, the Toaster provides much needed warmth in cold temperatures. Thoughtful details include soft trim around the neck and pockets, reflective piping, zipper pulls that can be grabbed with mittened hands, and insulation that's tapered in the arms, so movement isn't limited .Shell is abrasion-resistant 150-denier 2-layer polyester with a polyurethane waterproof breathable laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish. Seams are not taped, so this garment will not be fully waterproof in heavy rain.Printed lining glides over layers. Made of recycled polyester.Insulated with 300g MEC\u2122 Hyperloft in the body to keep the body core warm, and 240g Hyperloft in the arms and hood for freedom of movement.Trimmed with 360-degree reflective piping on hood, chest, and arms.Hood has internal elastic to seal in heat.Fleece lined collar with a fold-over chin guard for comfort and warmth.Full-coverage storm flap on front zipper, secured with hook-and-loop closure.Elasticized cuffs have internal storm cuffs to keep out cold and snow.2 front cargo pockets with flap and snap closures. Ski pass attachment in right pocket.2 hidden fleece-lined handwarmer pockets with zips behind the cargo pockets.Large internal drop-in pocket.Durable, child-friendly zipper pulls.Built in powder skirt keeps snow out and heat in.Hand-me-down ID label.\n\nRelaxed fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nTight, with no room to spare.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery close fit, with a bit of room.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerous, but not oversized.\n\n\n\n\n\nOversized with lots of room for layers.\n\n\nAll MEC men\u2019s and boy\u2019s pants are regular rise.\n\n\n\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",

      "Waterproof without taped seams"

    "Windproofness\n\nA windproof garment does not allow any air to permeate the fabric.  A garment with windproof panels has panels of fabric that are totally windproof, but the rest of the garment may not be windproof.
