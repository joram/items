  "description": "Keep your spares clothes dry without adding too much of weight to your pack or travel bag. Waterproof fabric sheds rain or snowmelt. The larger sizes are great for protecting a sleeping bag, and the wide mouths make them easy to stuff.Made of ultralight, high-tenacity 30-denier silicone treated ripstop nylon with a polyurethane coating.Seams are not taped, so they are not fully waterproof if saturated or dunked.Different colours for each size.Volume is screened on each bag for quick size selection, or identification of the contents.Drawcord closures.3L size is good for puffy jackets, or small compressible items.5 and 10L sizes fit most summer sleeping bags and are excellent for spare clothing.15 and 20L sizes fit 3 or 4-season sleeping bags.",
