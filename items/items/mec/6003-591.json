  "description": "Performance skate bindings with a manual locking binding. The ergonomic lever has a soft, secure grip that's intuitive and easy to use. It has an audible click, so you know when it's securely closed. The wide binding contact area adds torsional rigidity for good power transfer and control. The low-stack hight gives you a feel for the snow surface as you power across it.Skate flex index promoted power transfer and ski control (11.0 flex index; 40\u00b0 amplitude).Manual design uses an ergonomic turn lock to open and close the binding.Low-profile stack height is stable in the glide phase and feels precise as you ski.Compatible with IFP mounting plate only.Fits boots 32-43.",
