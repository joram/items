  "description": "This high-cut paddling bootie opens up with a side zip for slipping on and off easily. And it cinches snug with an adjustable elastic forefoot strap for a more comfortable, supportive fit that will stay on better in a swim (not that you ever blow a roll \u2013 we're talking purely hypothetically here).3mm neoprene is nylon-faced for greater durability.Plastic inner soles help blunt rocks and cobbles.Rubbery outsoles feature a triangular pattern for durability and better grip on wet surfaces.Sized in men\u2019s sizes. For a women\u2019s size, subtract one (for a women\u2019s size 8, choose size 7).  Round up if you are between full sizes.",
