  "description": "With over 800 routes, this guide is a complete reference to the sport climbing around Squamish. This guidebook covers climbs Murrin, northward through the Chek Canyon area, to Whistler, with plenty of photos, maps and topographic drawings. The Squamish Sport Climbs is the perfect compliment to the more trad-centric Squamish Rockclimbs.",
