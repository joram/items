  "description": "This handy stick clip will let you clip or unclip a distant first hanger, It also clips rope onto hanging draws, so you can 'squid-point' a sport route. It's threaded to mount onto standard painter poles, window-washer poles and other appropriately stiff extensions, but it won't fit flexible tent poles. Operating this extended arm and its wily plastic digits takes a bit of practice, so start figuring it out at home, before you get to the rock in front of your steely eyed peers.Extension pole must be purchased separately.",
