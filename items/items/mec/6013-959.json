  "description": "The beauty of a soft bottle lies in the fact that, once empty, it compacts to the size of a fist. The opening is a standard size, so the Seeker 2L works with other lids. Ideal for carrying extra water on a hike, paddling tour, road trip or anywhere else you need water and carry space is limited.Soft, grippable TPU is RF welded to create leakproof bonds.BPA-free, PVC-free and meets or exceeds FDA and EU regulations.Lash points make it easy to attach to a pack, kayak deck, or nearly anywhere else you need it.Soft bail handle is comfy to carry and doubles as a retention loop when the bottle is rolled up.42mm cap allows you to drink and pour with ease.Can be frozen or filled with hot water (max temp 60\u00b0C).\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPVC Free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      PVC free",
