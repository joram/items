  "description": "Jump-start curiosity with this take-along field guide for children ages 4 and up. From worms, birds and spiders to trees, flowers and clouds, young explorers learn what to look and listen for whether they're in a nature preserve, an urban park or a suburban backyard. Seek-and-find lists, on-the-trail art projects and discovery games get kids engaged in hands-on learning about nature, and a real pull-out magnifying glass helps them get a close-up glimpse of leaf veins, seed pods and tiny insects. Filled with activities, checklists and stickers, this interactive nature guide belongs in every kid\u2019s backpack.",
