Two layers of quilting wrap and insulate your body, and the blanket-like hood has hand pockets in the corners, so you can tuck yourself in just like you do at home.Shell is lightweight nylon, lining is soft polyester microfiber, both have a water-repellent finish.FireLine\u2122 Eco insulation uses 100% post-consumer recycled polyester. Durable, low denier fibres are tightly woven to provide high-loft, compressibility, a high weight-to-warmth ratio.Cocoon design holds insulation close to the body.Horizontal baffles create tunnels of warmth around your body and prevent insulation from shifting and creating cold spots.Anti-snag locking zipper operates ambidextrously.Draft flap behind zip ensures cold air doesn't sneak in.Optimized footbox mimics the natural position of your feet when lying on your side.Hood lets you lift and move your head, even when fully zipped up and has a one-handed cinch adjustment.Hang loops let you air it out in the sun.Includes a mesh storage bag and nylon stuff sack.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
