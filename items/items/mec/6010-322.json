    "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.

    "Waterproofness\n\nWaterproof garments use waterproof-breathable technologies and are fully seam-taped. Water-resistant garments use waterproof-breathable technologies but their seams are not taped. Water-resistant garments repel water and protect against wind but are not made of waterproof fabric.": [

    "Windproofness\n\nA windproof garment does not allow any air to permeate the fabric.  A garment with windproof panels has panels of fabric that are totally windproof, but the rest of the garment may not be windproof.  A wind-resistant garment resists some wind, but not as much as a garment that is windproof.": [
