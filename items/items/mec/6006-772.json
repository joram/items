  "description": "A slim line for fast and light missions. Not ideal as a project rope, but it meets both twin and half rope standards, so with 2 ropes, you can make fast progress as a team of three, get in long raps, and gain the safety margin of having two lines to work with.Ultra lightweight at 36g/m.EcoDry finish makes this rope durably water-repellent and dirt-resistant without the use of PFCs.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.Thermo-shield treatment results in a great feel and handling characteristics.3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling.Sheath proportion of 40% provides robustness to this lightweight rope.Specs shown are for use as a half rope.When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands):\nDynamic elongation: 29%\nStatic elongation: 5.2%\nImpact force: 10kN\nUIAA fall rating: 18\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product",
