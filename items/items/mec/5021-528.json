  "description": "A practical mix-and-match paddling piece with a female-specific fit. We\u2019ve designed it to be paired with the Fusion Shorts or Capris for core insulation in warmer water/weather, or with the Fusion Pants as a convenient alternative to a full Farmer Jane in cooler conditions.The Fusion series combines years of material development with exceptionally sophisticated patterning to produce neoprene that\u2019s more comfortable to wear while you're active, and warmer in the water if you swim.2mm, four-way super-stretch neoprene for maximum comfort and fit.Long in the back for good coverage when seated in a kayak or canoe.\n\nBody fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nOur next to skin fit that contours the body for no distractions\n\n\n\n\n\nOur close to body fit with a low profile silhouette for ease of movement\n\n\n\n\n\nOur standard, slightly off body fit for unrestricted comfort\n\n\n\n\n\nOur roomy, off body fit for maximum comfort and easy layering",
