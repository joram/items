  "description": "The Fixe replaces the Petzl\u00ae Fixed Side Pulley, and offers a well-considered balance of weight and strength. Designed for hauling systems, it\u2019s heavier, more durable and stronger than the very lightest pulleys, but not as burly as a rescue pulley. This model features thinner, stronger side plates, which eliminate the need for the weight-reducing holes that were on the old version, so the system has a cleaner design.Aluminum side plates.Self-lubricating bushings.Fixed side plates allow quick installation and coupling with a rope clamp.For ropes 7-13mm.Breaking strength is 23kN",
