They also make great food bags, since you can roll them smaller as you consume the contents.Made of lightweight nylon in the body, with tough polyester on the bottom.3D shapes with rounded corners fit efficiently in kayak compartments and backpacks.Welded and taped seams keep out water.20mm D-ring and buckle closures.Note: these dry bags do not provide submersible waterproof protection or impact protection. For electronics, we recommend hard cases with gasket seals.",
