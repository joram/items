  "description": "A high-volume and portable solution for purifying questionable water sources. Great for expeditions, off-grid living and overland adventures, the JerryCan purifies and filters water without the need for chemicals or UV light. The high-flow rate pumps out 4 litres of clean water per minute, so there's no waiting around when it's time to prep dinner.Stores 18.5L of dirty water.Hollow fibre technology uses polymer fibres to create a high-surface-area filter that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.015 micron effective pore size.Replaceable activated carbon disc reduces concentrations of some chemicals (including iodine and chlorine), odours and tastes.Includes flush cap and paper manual.Dimensions are 34 x 17 x 47.5cm.Meets NSF protocol P248 military standards.",
