  "description": "This technical midlayer is lightweight and breathable enough for climbing or fast hiking in alpine terrain. The fabric is Polartec Power Stretch fleece that provides a good level of insulation for ticking your way up an exposed pitch. An external coating resists the abrasive properties of exfoliating granite and weathered lichen, and it presents a moisture resistant face to the elements when you're wearing the Slipstream as an outer layer.Made of Polartec Power Stretch fleece, 90% polyester, 10% spandex.Hard face finish on the flat surface of the fabric increases its resistance to abrasion and prevents it from getting scruffy.Close fit hood won't block your vision.Full-length zip with a fold-over chin guard.Generous left chest pocket is accessible with one hand.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
