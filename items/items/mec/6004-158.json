  "description": "Give a little kick. Don\u2019t let hard pack or icy slopes hold you back. Twin Skin technology gives you plenty of reliable kick action and good glide. While already lightweight and stable, volcanic basalt fibres lighten the load even more and add nice flex.Twin Skin technology uses two separate mohair mix skin strips in offset positions to achieve smooth and balanced gliding without grip wax.Air core basalite technology provides lightness, torsion-free construction and highly stable sidewalls.Volcanic basalt fibres reduce the weight even further, while providing excellent flex characteristics.Mounting plate accepts compatible IPF bindings (bindings sold separately).",
