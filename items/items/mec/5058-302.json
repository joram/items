  "description": "The MEC legacy of durable, kids' rainwear continues. These aren't as light and supple as a previous version (made of 70-denier nylon) but for kids who see any object as possible playground equipment, the heavier oxford nylon is built to be waterproof and stand up to rolling, sliding and scaling.Made of burly oxford nylon with polyurethane coating and a highly effective DWR (durable water repellent) finish, for full-on waterproof protection.Fully taped seams for complete waterproof protection.Elasticized lower leg openings seal out drafts and water.Extended upper torso provides extra protection.Adjustable shoulder straps allow for growth spurts and layers of varying thickness.\n\nRegular fit, Regular rise\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nTight, with no room to spare.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery close fit, with a bit of room.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerous, but not oversized.\n\n\n\n\n\nOversized with lots of room for layers.\n\n\nAll MEC men\u2019s and boy\u2019s pants are regular rise.\n\n\n\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
