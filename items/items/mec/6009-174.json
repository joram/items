  "description": "Tough enough to work the moves, light enough to redpoint. The IonR 9.4mm is a high-performance rope that's substantial enough for cragging, without weighing down your pack on long approaches. A good balance of strength, versatility, and dry treatment make it suitable for projecting to desert tower adventures to waterfall ice.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.DryXP dry coating is certified to the UIAA Water Repellent standard of less than 5% water absorption. It protects the rope from water absorption, which reduces weight, prevents freezing, and slows down the wear on the sheath to a noticeable degree.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
