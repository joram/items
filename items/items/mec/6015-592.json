  "description": "Polar knows there's more to training than hitting start and stop. The Grit X analyzes training, nutrition and  recovery, to help you perform at your best. Internal GPS provides speed and distance info, an optical heart rate sensor provides all sorts of pulse-related metrics, and internal accelerometers translate your movements into information. There\u2019s even an internal running power meter, no foot pod needed. When paired with your phone running the free Polar Flow\u2122 app, you can review activities, download training plans, receive texts, social media alerts and emails, track the weather and more.130 different sport profiles are available to let you customize your watch (up to 20 profiles on the watch). Each profile has customizable data fields, zone limits, laps and more.Optical heart rate monitor uses Polar\u2019s Precision Prime\u2122 multicoloured LED sensor to measure heart rate right off your wrist.Komoot turn-by-turn navigation, plan your route, synch it over Bluetooth\u2122 and you\u2019re ready to go (Komoot region unlocking may be required).Strava\u2122 Live Segment integration lets you know when your starred segments are about to begin and shows instantaneous data (Strava premium required).HillSplitter\u2122 displays splits and counts ascents/descents for hill training.FuelWise\u2122 mode provides reminders to eat and drink as you train, and recaps your \u201cfuel sources\u201d after a workout to help you plan nutrition for the next workout.Nightly Recharge\u2122 shows quality of rest and recovering from training.FitSpark\u2122 suggests daily workouts to maintain current fitness level, with strength, cardio and supportive/flexibility focused options.Training Load Pro\u2122 breaks down how you train into 3 components: training load, cardio load, and muscle load, this data is used to tell you if you are over-training, on the right track, or under training.Swim training profile (pool and open water) detects stroke, distance, pace, strokes and rest times.Intelligent battery manager provides 40 hours of continuous training use, up to 100 hours with reduced GPS intervals and 7 days in watch mode.GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and QZSS satellite constellation support means a strong signal nearly anywhere on the globe.Free Polar Flow app can load workouts to your favourite training apps, like Strava, Training Peaks and more (uses your phone\u2019s Bluetooth connection).Bluetooth Smart lets you connect to a variety of different sensors to tell you more about how you train, including: power meters (cycling and running), cadence and speed sensors, foot pods, heart rate belts and more.Daily activity tracking with 24/7 heart rate data, steps and sleep tracking.ABC data comes in via the internal altimeter, barometer and compass.Rugged stainless-steel case.Tough, non-reflective Gorilla Glass\u00a9 screen.Bright colour touchscreen is easy to see in all conditions.Customizable watch faces let you choose how and what you see.100m water resistance.Standard 22mm strap makes customizing easy.Fits wrists 14.5-21.5cm in circumference.In the box: Grit X, charging cable and documentation.",
