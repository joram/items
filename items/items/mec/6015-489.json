  "description": "One rope to do it all, the Quest is a lightweight workhorse with low impact forces and a full dry treatment for sport, trad and ice lines. It has a firm hand for easy clipping and a smooth sheath that glides through gear and over rock. The new XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments.XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments.Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials.High sheath proportion adds durability.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
