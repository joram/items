  "description": "We've built this jacket to be super versatile. Its light insulation, dovetail hem, and weather protection makes it a great choice for little ones to wear out on their active adventures. When the day's play is over and it's time for a ride home in the bike trailer or sled, the Bundle Up's slender profile fits nicely under a garment like the Newt Suit. Reversible fabric goes from graphic printed, to solid colour in one flip.Shell and lining are recycled polyester with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish.Insulated with 100g PrimaLoft Black Eco recycled polyester.Chin guard protects the neck and chin from chafing.Two handwarmer pockets.Hand-me-down ID label.Can be washed in cold water and dried on gentle settings.
