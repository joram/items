  "description": "A new standard of camping comfort. The Fireside 0C Sleeping Bag is a deluxe sleeping experience that makes you feel at home on car camping trips, rafting expeditions or outdoor festivals. It's roomy enough to starfish as you sleep and you can roll over without sliding off your sleeping pad. You can open it if you get too warm, and convert the top panel into blanket.Shell is made of recycled polyester with a DWR finish that sheds condensation.Lined with super-soft polyester that feels like cotton.Insulated with MEC Hyperloft synthetic insulation with 50% recycled content.Dual zippers (YKK #8) let you open up either side of the bag or zip off the top panel to use as a blanket around the campfire.Perimeter draft tube keeps heat in and cold out.Low-profile adjustable hood lets you cinch it down when it's chilly. Plus, it holds your (regular-size!) pillow in place.Elasticized pockets on the back of the bag hold your sleeping pad in place so you can't slip off. Regular is compatible with 63.5 x 183cm pads. Long is compatible with 63.5 x 198cm pads.Includes a stuff sack and a home storage bag.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
