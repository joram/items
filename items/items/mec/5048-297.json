  "description": "The Cramp-O-Matic system uses a time-proven nylon lever in the rear and a stainless steel bale in front to hold your boots securely. Quick to put on, these bindings are designed for mountaineering boots that have a rigid sole and substantial heel and toe welts. A stainless steel safety strap is permanently mounted on the front bale and prevents loss, in case the crampon gets twisted or otherwise forced off your boot.Made of chromoly steel.12-point design suits general mountaineering, alpinism, mixed ice, and moderate waterfall ice.4 points are perpendicular to the rails to prevent shearing in soft snow and add security while descending.Fully adjustable without tools.Folds down for transport.Antibott included.",
