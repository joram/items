  "description": "To keep up with committed tri-athletes, this bundle includes Garmin's powerful HRM-Tri and HRM-Swim straps to provide nuanced swimming and running data, with a Quick Release kit to help speed up transitions. In a Forerunner first, the 945 looks at more than how you train but also where you train. Environmental details like elevation and temperature are now factored into your performance data. Climate acclimation has a real effect on your race day performance, the 945 helps give you an idea of what you can expect with its race predictor. Speed, distance, pace and more come in via a new, more efficient GPS, along with other internal sensors. The latest generation Elevate heart rate monitor lets the 945 read your pulse straight off your wrist. When you need more information, or even a little motivation, you can download training plans through the free Garmin Connect app. When paired with a smartphone running Garmin Connect your 945 goes from a training tool, to an everyday tool. Garmin Connect lets you review activities, receive texts, social media alerts, emails, etc., keep an eye on the weather and more. The 945 can even give your training a soundtrack, with the ability to connect to multiple music services and storage for up to 1000 songs. With tunes and podcasts on your wrist, you can cut weight and leave your phone at home. Pre-loaded with detailed maps, the 945 can help you get where you need to go. And, for those times you know how far you want to go, but don't have a course in mind, the 945 can help. Enter your desired distance and the 945 will use its maps and track data from other Garmin users to calculate multiple course options that start and stop right were you are.Modes for biking, running, swimming (indoor and outdoor), multisport \u2013 transition between activities within a single workout, gym focused activities (strength training \u2013 with rep counter, cardio and elliptical training, stair stepping, indoor rowing and yoga) and more.Included HRM-Tri\u2122 strap stores swim data when in the water, and uploads to your 945 when finished. Garmin's smallest and lightest strap ever produced.Included HR-Swim\u2122 strap is Garmin's first dedicated swim strap. Non-slip design stays in place even during wall push-offs and is resistant to pool chemicals.Optical heart rate sensors are not able to reliably record heart rate while under water.  For heart rate data during your swims, you will need either the HRM Swim or HRM TRI.Included quick release kit lets you go from handlebar to wrist and back again with a quick quarter turn.Includes North American map data with room to add more maps.Point of interest navigation lets you search for places you may want to go, e.g restaurants, attractions, accommodation, etc.Round-trip mapping: choose your distance and the 945 plots course options that start and stop in the same spot.Trendline\u2122 routing uses Garmin Connect\u2019s database of routes to find the most popular way to get you from A-to-B.Stream music through your smartphone using Spotify, iHeartRadio, Pandora or Deezer. Or, download playlists and podcasts via your favourite music service, e.g. Spotify (premium account required), you can even drag and drop MP3s from your computer \u2013 holds up to 1,000 songs.Playlists synced from streaming services can be updated over Wi-Fi.Power alerts and lap data can come through to your paired Bluetooth\u2122 headphones.ClimbPro\u2122 mode breaks down the climbs in your activity, letting you know the grade, the total ascent, how much more you have to go and displays an elevation profile, so you know how to pace yourself.Garmin Pay\u2122; by linking credit cards to your Garmin account, you can make payments with your watch (if supported by your bank).Strava Segment integration \u2013 both preloaded and on-the-fly (through your phone) \u2013 lets you know when your starred segment is about to begin and shows instantaneous data, how it compares to your PR and the current KOM or QOM, and then provides results once the segment is complete (requires Strava premium).Connects to 3 different satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS and Galileo) and caches satellite positions, giving you a fast connection and a strong GPS signal anywhere.Internet Live Tracking during activities (through a connected smartphone) allows you to share your location and fitness data.GroupTrack\u2122 displays the location and telemetry of up to 50 others.Pre-set messaging between compatible Garmin units, when combined with Live Tracking, means real-time location and messaging.UltraTrac\u2122 mode reduces the GPS recording rate to conserve battery, providing up to 60 hours of GPS use.Equipped with Garmin\u2019s V3 low-profile Elevate\u2122 optical heart rate monitor which provides more reliable heart rate data. Elevate V3 includes a red LED to provide Pulse Ox measurements.Training load uses data from your past 7-days to let you know if you are overtraining, under-training, or on the right path.Physiological metrics includes VO2 max \u2013 which now takes ambient temperature and altitude into consideration, a race predictor, recovery advisor and performance indicator.Included HRM-Tri provides running dynamics for cadence, ground contact time, stride length, vertical oscillation and vertical ratio.Incident detection uses the internal sensors to detect if an accident has occurred.  In the case of an accident the unit will notify your emergency contacts through your paired smartphone with a message for help and your location.Free Garmin Connect app lets you review activities, receive texts, social media alerts, emails, etc., download training plans, keep an eye on the weather and more, all via Bluetooth connection to your phone.Connect IQ allows you to download apps, templates, data fields, watch faces, and more.In the box: Forerunner 945, extra black strap, HRM-Tri monitor, HRM-Swim monitor, Quick release kit, charging/data cable, manuals.",
