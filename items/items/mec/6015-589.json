  "description": "This interactive direct-drive trainer makes it easy to study your cadence, power, and speed, while simulating real-road scenarios. Link to a desired training app from any device. With up to 15% gradient simulation and 2.5% accuracy, it's great if you're looking for versatility and precision without complicated setup. Use it at home or the office during the darkest days of winter, and come summer, it's compact enough to bring out for a pre-race warm-up in the parking lot.Includes a 30-day coupon for Zwift\u00ae and 12 month subscription to My E-Training from ELITE.Electronically controlled magnetic trainer provides a predictable and consistent linear increase in resistance.Sensor-less design gathers data without extras on your bike, keeping your bike clean.2.5% accuracy ensures you get a precise picture of each training session.ANT+\u2122, FE-C and Bluetooth\u2122 control lets your app of choice change resistance.Compatible with: Zwift, TrainerRoad\u00ae, Kinomap\u00ae, Rouvy\u00ae, The Sufferfest\u00ae, Bikevo\u00ae and more.Works with previously installed ergometers.Realistic slope simulation of up to 15%.Maximum brake power of 1900W at 40km/h or 2900W at 60km/h.Compatible with standard 9, 10 and 11 speed cassettes by SRAM or Shimano (cassette sold separately).Freehub body available separately for Campagnolo.Suitable for 130 to 135mm hubs with 5mm QR and up to 142x12mm.Adapters available separately for axles: 148x12mm (Boost), 135x10mm and 135x12mm.",
