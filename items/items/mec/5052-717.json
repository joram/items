  "description": "These nuts will find a home on intermediate to experienced climber's racks, who find themselves looking at flaring and shallow cracks as the only placement options.Made of heat-treated aluminum alloy to maximize strength and bite.Colour-coded sizing with upside-down labels for easy ID on your harness.Tops are recessed so the wire sits flush.Countersunk drill holes prevent stress points where the wire enters, and protects them from wear.Tumbled to remove sharp edges.Wires are matched to nut size, so they can be placed at full reach without flopping.Full size crimp for strength.Lightening holes in the larger sizes reduce weight.",
