  "description": "A light touring ski that performs in a range of conditions, because you can't pick your snow conditions, but you can pick your skis. With a wood core from toe to tail and a carbon backbone to stiffen it up, the Backland 95 lets you reach deep mountain terrain and quickly lap your skintrack for another run. The HRZN Tech tip is spoon-shaped to provide extra float in powder, and still performs on crud and hardpack.Core is made of poplar and caruba wood to bring the weight as low as possible.Carbon Backbone adds snap and edge-hold with very minimal weight penalty.HRZN Tech spoon-like tip reduces deflection and improves control in powder.Full sidewall construction improves steering.All Mountain Rocker is 15% rocker in the tip and 85% camber underfoot with a flat tail.7000-series sintered base holds wax very well for fast glide in any snow conditions.Topsheets are lightweight and wear-resistant.",
