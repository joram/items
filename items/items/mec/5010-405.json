  "description": "Use this double-end cable with a U-lock or padlock to secure a bike to a rack or a large, solid structure. It's longer and thicker than a standard cable, with different-sized end loops, so you can get creative with hitches and loops.2 swaged ends with different loop sizes.Dimensions are 15mm x 2.5m.To secure an expensive bike, or any bike in a public, high-risk area, we recommend a strong U-lock or a combination U-lock and cable lock.",
