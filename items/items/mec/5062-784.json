    "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.  Values under 8,000g/m2/24h provide low performance, 20,000g/m2/24h provide moderate performance and values over 30,000g/m2/24h provide high performance.": [
