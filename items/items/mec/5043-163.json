  "description": "The perfect rope for complete climbing serenity. For anything from single-pitch sport to long days on big walls. Beal ropes have a lower impact force for a given diameter than other brands. This reduces forces on the anchor, belayer, and climber.Sharp edge resistance for greater peace of mind.Supple sheath is easy to manipulate and highly clippable.Unicore construction bonds the sheath and core so there should never be any sheath slippage.Dry Cover sheath treatment for protection from dirt.Diameter makes it heavier, but increases overall safety reserves.Beal plants a tree for every rope sold.",
