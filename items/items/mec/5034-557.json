  "description": "The CR stands for Crevasse Rescue, the X means weight has been carved off. Stronger than many larger pulleys, it fits neatly in a pocket or pack for quick access. With prusik minding sideplates, this little pulley is a great companion in the alpine. Small and light as it is, it is not for organized SAR use or Tyrolean traverses. Use it for emergency cravasse and rescue systems.Aluminum sideplates with nylon sheave and bushings, steel axle.Rounded sidplates rotate easily to secure placement at any point on the rope.Working load suits personal rescue only.Wide base works with prusik cords up to 8mm.Dimensions are 7.5 x 4.5cm.",
