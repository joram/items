  "description": "Shrug into classic fleece comfort. The Acclimate Shrug Off jacket is right at home on chilly fall morning in the city, or around camp. When the temperatures start to drop this mid-weight fleece layers under a rain shell or ski jacket when it is time to hit the slopes.Crafted from a soft recycled polyester fleece that holds in warmth and wicks away moisture.Fitted hood ups the warmth factor and tucks easily under a shell\u2019s hood.Gusset under the sleeve and offset seams keep movement free and easy.Elastic binding at the hood, cuffs, and hemline help keep the cool out and the warm in.Internal hanger loop decreases the chance of this ending up in the clothing pile.Dual handwarmer pockets keep chill winds at bay.Name tag on the inside reduces confusion after sleep overs or around camp.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
