  "description": "Low pressure, high performance, no snake bites. 2 chambers really are better than one. Built for tubeless MTB tires, this system uses an inner and outer chamber to give you the best of both worlds. Run the outer chamber as low as 1 bar to give you maximum traction, control and cushion. The inner runs at 4-6 bar to prevent snake bites and burping. If the outer one punctures, the inner one has enough air get you home without walking. Get the ultimate downhill performance without sacrificing durability or reliability.2-chamber design: outer runs at low pressure to improve performance, inner runs at high pressure to prevent snake bites and burping.Works with all tubeless MTB tires with inner width of at least 23mm.Special valve lets you easily inflate each chamber to the perfect pressure.",
