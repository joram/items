  "description": "Maglite pioneered the category of tough, metal-bodied flashlights. Their classic keychain light now uses an LED instead of a bulb, so it\u2019s brighter, burns longer, and is tougher than ever.Anodized aluminum body is knurled for a non-slip grip.Reliable rotary on/off switch provides a focusable beam and eliminates a potential point for water entry.Both ends are sealed with O-rings to resist rain and splashes.",
