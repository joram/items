  "description": "Know where your going, on-road and off-road, without needing your phone. Pick a point on the map or load a course and the Edge 530 gets you there with phone-free, turn-by-turn navigation. Trendline routing looks at other Garmin Connect user\u2019s data for that area, leveraging millions of trips to find the best rides and most efficient routes. Real-time Strava segment integration speaks to your competitive side, displaying nearby segments, showing how you compare to your PR and the current KOM or QOM. Live Tracking continues to evolve, with rider-to-rider pre-set messaging and real-time location displayed right on your Edge. When connected to your phone via the free Garmin Connect app, you can receive texts, social media alerts, emails, download training plans, review activities, keep an eye on the weather and more.On board North American maps let you navigate to saved points, through courses created or downloaded and transferred through Garmin Connect Mobile or Strava (via the Connet IQ app), the unit will even re-route you if you get off course.Back to start feature brings you home safely, directing you back to where you started your ride.Trendline\u2122 routing uses Garmin Connect\u2019s database of rider\u2019s routes and tracks, and finds the most popular routes; letting you ride like a local, wherever you are, on or off road.ClimbPro\u2122 mode breaks down the climbs in your ride, letting you know the grade, the total ascent, remaining ascent and elevation profile, so you can pace yourself.Mountain biking dynamics include 3 new metrics, jumps: number of jumps, hangtime, distance and speed, grit: overall trail difficulty, and flow: a score of how smoothly you rode the trail e.g. did you over brake in a corner.TrailForks\u2122 integration lets you access and navigate through the immense TrailForks trail database without needing a cellular connection. You can even log into your account and save rides, check-in on trails, etc.ForkSight mode uses TraliForks data when you get to a fork in the trail, telling about your choices, e.g. trail rating, distance, elevation, etc.Strava Segment integration \u2013 both preloaded and on-the-fly (through connection with your phone) \u2013 lets you know when your starred segment is about to begin and shows instantaneous data, not just of your performance in the moment, but also how it compares to your PR and the current KOM or QOM, and then provides results once the segment is complete. (requires Strava premium)Live Tracking during activities (through a connected smartphone) allows you to share your location, speed, and more, with friends, family, or coaches.GroupTrack\u2122 displays the location and telemetry of up to 50 of your contacts that are using compatible Garmin devices.Pre-set messaging between compatible Edge units, when combined with Live Tracking, means real-time location and messaging, no more stopping to check your phone.Find my Edge feature let\u2019s you know if your Edge loses its connection to your phone. Should your Edge fall off, you get a lost-connection alert with location and exact GPS coordinates. Once in Bluetooth\u2122 range you can trigger an alarm on your device, letting you know exactly where it is.Training plan takes you through the details of your ride: weather \u2013 including the recommended clothing for the conditions, food and water requirements based on your fitness levels \u2013 even providing reminders of when you should drink and eat, and much more.Environmental factors like heat and altitude acclimation are taken into consideration when calculating performance and recovery metrics.Training status helps you optimize your training, guiding you where you need to push and where you may need to dial it back.Bike alarm mode adds a bit of peace of mind to bathroom stops, water stops and anywhere you need to refuel or de-fuel, sounding a loud, shrill, attention getting alarm if your bike is touched.Incident detection uses the Edge\u2019s accelerometers to detect if an accident has occurred.  In the case of an accident the unit will send a signal through your paired smartphone to predefined emergency contacts, letting them know where you are and that you need help.A powerful, internal antenna connects to 3 different satellite constellations, GPS, GLONASS and Galileo. Multiple networks, combined with satellite position caching, give you a fast connection and a strong GPS signal wherever you are.Connect IQ support allows you to download apps, templates, data fields, and other features.Free Garmin Connect app lets you review activities, receive texts, social media alerts, emails, etc., download training plans, keep an eye on the weather and more.Bluetooth\u2122 and ANT+\u2122 sensor support.Improved processor lets you navigate maps faster, load courses faster and just spend less time fiddling with the computer and more time riding.Barometric altimeter helps you track your ascents, descents, and total elevation changes.Customizable screens let you choose what you want to see where.Included out the front mount holds the Edge flush with the handlebars, and allows the connection to the external battery pack (sold separately).In the box: Edge 530, mounts (flush out-front and standard), USB cable, tether and manuals.",
