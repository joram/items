  "description": "Follow this treasure map to the wonders of Joshua Tree National Park. Explore this stunning area with Robert Miramontes, a local photographer, explorer and rock climber with intimate knowledge of the Park. Enjoy the twisted architecture of the Joshua trees themselves, the rock labyrinths of Wonderland of Rocks, the vast ocotillo-speckled Pinto Basin and other little-traveled corners of the Park. Discover hikes of all categories: from wheelchair-accessible nature trails to highly unofficial belly-crawls through granite corridors. Sweat your way up a desert summit with 100-mile views, scramble to the top of a rock dome, or trek up a canyon to a palm oasis. Did you know the Park has a rich mining history? Visit off-the-radar mine sites and quirky desert homesteads. If you want to get away from the parking lots, whether for a full-day outing or a 30-minute scramble, this is your book.",
