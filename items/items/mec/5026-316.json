  "description": "Skip the plastic bags. This reusable tote is made from salvaged fabric left over from making MEC backpacks. It crumples down small to fit in a pocket or purse, and its 45L capacity is large enough for trips to the wholesale warehouse, tons of groceries or hauling camping gear to the car.2 sets of nylon webbing handles allow carrying by hand or over the shoulder.Box stitch reinforcements add strength and durability.As these are made from off-cut fabrics left over from making backpacks, the colour you receive may not be the colour shown.",
