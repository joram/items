  "description": "Preloaded with more than 80 activity profiles, your Suunto 5 comes out of the box, ready to train. Equipped with an optical heart rate monitor, the 5 brings an extra layer of precision to your training. Your 5 will learn your current activity level and provide you with a personalized training plan. Your plan gives you live updates, letting you know when to go harder, or to slow down, it will also adapt if you miss a workout, or crush it a bit harder than you needed to. Suunto\u2019s intelligent power management software keeps an eye on your 5\u2019s battery. Modes and settings can be changed on the fly, giving you enough power for that last kilometer, or the next 10. Pair your watch with the free Suunto app and the 5 gains a whole new feature set. The Suunto app lets you interact with other fitness platforms, transfer activities, receive notifications (calls, texts, reminders, etc.), share activities, plan routes using heatmaps and more. Heatmaps overlay other Suunto users\u2019 activities over local maps. This makes it easy to find the most popular runs, rides, trails, or swims, wherever Suunto users play. A full suite of activity tracker functionality tracks your activity outside of your training modes, making sure you get credit for every calorie. Your 5\u2019s sleep tracking mode will even keep an eye on you when your eyes are shut.Equipped with Valencell\u2019s optical heart rate monitor allowing you to train without a chest strap.Personalized training plans help you refine your training for maximum efficiency.Personalized 7-day training plans adapt on the fly, perfect if you miss a day, or giv\u2019r harder than you had planned.Activity bar counts down your training session, giving you a quick visual of how long you need to train to reach your goals.Resources mode tracks your energy levels throughout the day. By monitoring what drains your energy (exercise) and recharges your energy (rest, food, etc.), you get a better idea of how, and when to train.Keeps track of your up-to-date on your personal bests by sport.  As well as showing progress trends for activities like: running, cycling, swimming (Bluetooth heart rate belt required for accuracy in the water), and many more, seeing trends is a quick and easy way to gauge the effectiveness of your training.FusedSpeed\u2122 combines GPS and accelerometer data to provide a very stable running pace.Loaded with more than 80 different sport modes, from running, swimming, cycling and many more, there is a sport specific mode and metrics for nearly every activity.Multisport mode lets you change sports within a single exercise session.2 pre-set intelligent battery profiles adjust settings to get the most out of your remaining battery, custom battery profiles can be personalized for your various activities.Battery profiles can be saved to different activities, great for exercises with different power requirements, e.g. slower paced activities like hiking don\u2019t need to check-in with GPS as regularly as fast activities like running and cycling. So, your battery will last longer when you hike that it does when you run or ride.Dynamic battery monitoring suggests power changes on the fly..When the battery hits 2%, low battery detection mode switches off everything but the activity timer.Intelligent battery reminders learn your activity patterns and remind you to charge your watch leading up to your next activity.Breadcrumb style navigation tracks your route on your 5-series, you can overlay the track in a variety of map apps.Connects to GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations for fast signal acquisition and a strong connection nearly anywhere.24/7 activity tracking, learning your activity level and guiding you towards a more active lifestyle.Stress levels monitor heart rate variability while inactive to produce a stress evaluation, the lower the score, the lower your stress.On board sleep tracking mode monitors your rest, letting you see your total sleep hours, giving you a report on your night\u2019s sleep once you wake up.Bluetooth Smart connects to fitness sensors, from heart rate monitors to bike speed and cadence sensors, as well as phones featuring Bluetooth 4.0 and above.  Note that 5-series will only connect to Bluetooth Smart sensors.Free Suunto app lets you connect and sync to your favourite training apps, like Strava and TrainingPeaks. Meaning you get share that new PB with your community as you finish.Suunto app enables sharing your metrics with coaches and personal trainers, opening up a whole world of digital training plans and tips.Automatically syncs data to paired phones running the free Suunto app.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) come in via Bluetooth connection to a compatible phone.Suunto Link free web platform provides free software updates adding functionality and improving performance.Fits wrists 13-21.5cm.In the box: Suunto 5, USB cable, quick guide, warranty leaflet and a Suunto sticker.",
