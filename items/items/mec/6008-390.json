  "description": "Designed in partnership with multiple Downhill World Championship Greg Minnaar, this all-conditions tire has tall, sharp knobs to punch through dust and loam to find grip. Hard-packed or muddy, dry or wet and rooty, the Assegai provides the grip and cornering support required by riders at the top of the sport.Tubeless ready tire means lower air pressure, improved traction, lower rolling resistnace and less chance of flatting.Intermediate (not too soft, not too hard) rubber compound is designed offer a balance of traction, speed and durability.EXO protection increases sidewall durability, abrasion and cut resistance.Wide trail spacing is optimized for 30-35mm inner width rims.",
