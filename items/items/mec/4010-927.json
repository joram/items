  "description": "Simple to operate, a sturdy stove suitable for all temperate outdoor activities. It's convenient, just light it and cook, no pumping required, and it simmers precisely. LPG stoves do not function well at below-zero temperatures at low or medium altitudes, since the pressure inside LPG cartridges is reduced by the cold. At very high altitudes, the lower ambient air pressure helps offset the reduced internal cartridge pressure and improves sub-zero performance.Stainless steel body, brass fittings.Uses butane/propane canisters (sold separately). 225g canisters boil about 15L of water. 450g canisters boil about 30L of water.",
