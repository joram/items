  "description": "A stripped-down, svelte version of Osprey's popular Ariel AG pack, the Ariel Pro 65 is ready to tackle long trips with heavy loads. Osprey has lightened up the fabric and trimmed back the features without skimping on durability or comfort. With just one zipper and beefed-up hardware, there's less to break. And that's just what you need when you're heading out for some Type 2 fun in landscapes where the only trail is the one you make.Made of Osprey NanoFly\u00ae 210-denier nylon that integrates ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene for remarkable abrasion resistance.Aluminum 7075 peripheral frame effectively transfers the load to the hipbelt, while the single center stay maintains the back panel shape.Airscape backpanel has foam cutouts with a mesh overlay for a comfortable body-contact surface.Isoform4 hipbelt can be heat moulded for a customized fit.Sternum strap has an integrated safety whistle.Women's specific design has shoulder straps and a hipbelt that accommodate curves and a shorter torso length.Removable floating top lid has a zippered pocket for small items.Large hipbelt pockets carry easy-access essentials and can be removed if you don't need them.Stow-on-the-Go system lets you stash your trekking poles without removing your pack.Dual removable loops with cord attachments secure ice tools.2 front compression straps cinch in the load and let you attach extra gear. Z-pull side compression straps are removable.Removable bottom straps carry a sleeping pad.Internal sleeve with hanger loop and port carry a hydration reservoir (sold separately).Reinforced cord loops let you attach an Osprey Daylite pack or Alpine Pocket (sold separately).Osprey recommends this pack for loads of 15-27kg/35-60lb.",
