  "description": "Throw it on during lunch breaks or when stepping out of the hut to shovel new snow. The Tremblant Jacket is a welcome warm layer that easily packs down into a compact little package. The fabric slides easily beneath a shell jacket and the over-stuffed shoulders are designed to surround you with warmth that won't get packed down and compressed when you wear the jacket layered under your pack.Shell is made of water-resistant Pertex Quantum that compresses down to an insignificant size.Lined with recycled polyester that glides over layers.Insulated with 700-fill power down that meets the Responsible Down Standard for animal welfare.Sewn-through construction keeps the down in place.Shoulders are overfilled to prevent the down from shifting.Down-filled hood has elastic edge binding to seal out drafts.Storm flap behind zipper has a microfleece chin guard that wraps over the zipper.Elasticized wrists keep heat in.Articulated elbows move freely.Shockcord hem seals drafts out and warmth in.Back length is 28in.\n\nRegular fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nGarments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use.
