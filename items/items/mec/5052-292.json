  "description": "Get bomber placements with these wired hexes. They create a camming action in parallel sided cracks, and are way lighter than a big rack of cams. You do have to find the right spot to seat them, but the tapered sides allow a great range of placement options.Sizes 1-4 are solid extrusion, the rest are hollow.Sides are tapered so piece can be placed sideways in constrictions.One hex fits four different crack configurations.Made of colour-coded aluminum with steel wires.",
