  "description": "Steep ice one day, hard dry tooling the next. The updated Dart Crampons feature modular front points that can be configured to short or long mono-points, dual-point, or asymmetrical dual-point depending on what you're climbing on a given day. The lightweight horizontal frame keeps your boot sole close to the ice for precise placements and sensitivity when edging or working your way past aerated ice.Modular front points allow you to configure crampons to your climb.Secondary points are swept forward to add stability on funky formations.Third row of teeth are inclined backward for purchase when backstepping.Front points can be replaced when worn out.Leverlock FIL binding system has a toe bail wire with 3 positions to accommodate all sole thicknesses. Can be adjusted to fit asymmetric technical boots.Heel bail design with thumb catch is easy to remove.Medium linking bar (provided) fits boots sizes 34 to 44.Anti-snow plates included.Fits boots with toe and heel welts.",
