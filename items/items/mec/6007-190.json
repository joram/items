  "description": "Summer can't get here fast enough. This full performance wetsuit is just the right thickness for summer surfing at Cox Bay or White Point. And it's got a secret: no neoprene! Yup, this wetsuit is made from recycled materials. And it still gives you the comfort and durability you need for riding the waves while being a little kinder to the earth.EicoPrene is non-allergenic and neoprene-free, made of 70% limestone and 30% recycled tires.3mm thick EicoPrene on the torso and 2mm thick EicoPrene on the legs and arms.Mesh panels on back and chest reduce evaporative cooling and cut the wind.Glideskin neckline provides a smooth and comfortable fit reducing leakage and chaffing.Critical seam taping reduces leakage and provides a comfortable fit.Thermal lining is made with nylon sourced from recycled fishing nets.STD lining uses recycled polyester to retain body heat.Blind-stitched (GBS) seams use tough nylon thread to reduce leakage.Seams are triple glued with eco-friendly AquaA glue.Back zipper entry.Drain holes.Fuse cut cuffs are extra durable.Key pocket.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
