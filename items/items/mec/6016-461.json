Ride streets with an eye-catching flash or any other light mode you choose, without having to cycle through modes you never use.5 levels: 100%, 75%, 50%, 20% and flash. Light locks into lowest setting when power is 5% or less.Free app allows profile customization over Bluetooth\u00ae.2.4GHz wireless remote control for switching modes or powing on and off.Single button control: easy to use with gloves on, and remembers last mode used.Customized optics offer wide, flood light (20\u00ba spread).USB rechargeable 5200mAh battery straps to frame.Battery doubles as a USB powerbank (5V, 2A output).4-level LED battery status works when charging or in use.Machined aluminum housing with integrated heat-sink reduces heat build up.IPX4 weatherproofing keeps the light shining during heavy rain.O-ring mounting system fits all handlebars.Note: when not in use, the remote draws a small amount of power, enough to drain the battery over 1-2 weeks.
