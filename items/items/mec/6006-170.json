  "description": "This set of super-bright lights lets you add a lot of visibility without adding a lot of weight. With USB charging and 5 different modes, it's a worthwhile addition to your kit. Knog developed a clever magnetic mount that lets you swap your Plus light from your bike to you, or just off your bike with a click. An integrated clip lets you attach the lights to you clothing or your 4-legged friend on low-light outings.  Weighing in at a paltry 12 grams a piece these little lights won\u2019t slow you down or tug at your kit.Magnetic mount lets you attach your light to the bike mount base with little more than a magnetic click. Mount base includes multiple different sized o-rings for mounting to bars, posts, stays or even your helmet vents.Integrated clip lets you attach the lights to you, your pack, your pooch, really anything you want easily seen.5 different modes: steady, strobe, pulse, fancy flash and eco flash.Front light is 40 lumens and the rear light is 20 lumens.Waterproof design means that if you are willing to ride in it, the Plus will keep shining.Simple 1-button interface lets you cycle through modes with a short press or lock the light (so it won\u2019t turn on in your bag) with a long press.Integrated USB plug (type-A) means you don\u2019t need to tote around a cable to charge your light.Easy USB charging means there are no longer any reasons to have dim light.In the box: Plus Rear, Plust Front, 4x interchangeable straps for bars/seat posts 22-27mm / 28-32mm+ and 2x magnetic mount bases.",
