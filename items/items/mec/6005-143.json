Get phone-free, turn-by-turn point of interest navigation, and worldwide trail maps. Select by address, or browse categories (restaurants, locations, attractions). Garmin\u2019s Trendline routing leverages millions of trips in Garmin Connect to find  the best rides and most efficient routes. Strava segment integration displays nearby segments to compare to your PR and current KOM or QOM. Connect your phone via Garmin Connect to receive texts, social media alerts, emails, download training plans, review activities, keep an eye on the weather and more.Searchable maps (North America) let you enter an address like you would in your phone or in-car GPS. Guided navigation even re-routes you if you get off course.Point of interest navigation lets you search for places like restaurants, attractions, hospitals, accommodation and more.Trendline\u2122 routing uses Garmin Connect\u2019s database of rider\u2019s routes and tracks to find popular routes.ClimbPro\u2122 mode for grade, total ascent, remaining ascent and elevation profile.Mountain biking dynamics for jumps: number of jumps, hangtime and distance, grit: overall trail difficulty, and flow: a measure of your ride.TrailForks\u2122 integration lets you access and navigate through the immense TrailForks trail database without needing a cellular connection. You can even log into your account and save rides, check-in on trails, etc., all from your Edge!ForkSight mode uses TraliForks data when you get to a fork in the trail, telling about your choices, e.g. trail rating, distance, elevation, etc.Strava Segment integration (requires premium) shows starred segments and instantaneous data at segment completion.Live Tracking during activities via smartphone shares your location, speed and more.GroupTrack\u2122 displays the location and telemetry of up to 50 of your contacts using compatible Garmin devices.Pre-set messaging between compatible Edge units, when combined with Live Tracking for real-time location and messaging.Find my Edge provides a lost-connection alert with location and exact GPS coordinates. Once in Bluetooth\u2122 range you can trigger an alarm on your device.Training plan includes recommended clothing for conditions, food and water requirements based on your fitness levels amd reminders to eat or drink.Environmental factors like heat and altitude acclimation are used in performance and recovery metrics.Training status helps you optimize your training, guiding you where you need to push and where you may need to dial it back.Bike alarm mode.Incident detection: in case of accident, the unit sends a signal through your phone to your emergency contacts.Garmin Connect app lets you review activities, receive texts, social media alerts, emails, download training plans, keep an eye on the weather and more.Comfortable, accurate, (ANT+) chest strap.Speed and Cadence sensors use both Bluetooth\u2122 and ANT+\u2122 secure digital transmission technology.Speed sensor tracks rides without phone or bike computer and synchs through Garmin Connect or computer when in range.Sensors are easy to install, maintain and move between bikes.Speed Sensor attaches to a standard hub on either wheel and self-calibrates for accurate speed and distance while stationary (on a trainer) or on the move.Cadence Sensor fastens to any crank arm size and measures pedal strokes per minute.Barometric altimeter helps you track your ascents, descents, and total elevation changes.In the box: Edge 830, mounts (flush out-front and standard), speed sensor 2, cadence sensor 2, premium heart-rate strap, USB cable, tether and manuals.",
