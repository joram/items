  "description": "A dive computer, GPS, activity tracker, smartwatch all in one. No matter how you dive \u2013 single gas, mixed gas or free \u2013 you'll get important info for underwater exploring: dive time, ascent and descent rates, no-deco time, decompression stop information, heart-rate data, heading information and gas data. The EXO antenna connects to both standard GPS satellites and GLONASS satellites for fast and accurate GPS signals wherever you are. Wireless data syncing to Garmin Connect lets you share dives or land-based activities. With detailed dive analysis, day-to-day activity tracking, smart notifications, multi-sport functions, turn-by-turn mapping and round-trip mapping, the Descent Mk1 Titanium is useful above the waves and below.Dive modes support: single gas, multi-gas (blends and up to 6 gases), gauge, apnea, apnea hunt (silent) and plan dive.Customizable alerts (audible and haptic) for time, depth, ascent rate, descent rate and more (available alerts vary with type of dive).3 dive-specific data pages provide core information (dive time, depth, water temperature, compass heading, heart rate, gas mix). Note: for safety reasons, it's not possible to change settings and alter modes while diving.Dive activities start when depth gauge reaches 1.2m.100-metre waterproofing (EN 13319 standard).Access the 3-axis compass by double-tapping the screen.Large internal memory and fast processor handle turn-by-turn and round-trip mapping.Round-trip mapping lets you choose the distance you want to go. Installed maps plot course options that bring you back to where you started.Virtually scratchproof domed sapphire crystal face and titanium bezel.Titanium bracelet has a wear-resistant diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating to add extra durability and corrosion protection.Wi-Fi-enabled for activity uploads to Garmin Connect\u2122 to share dive logs and activities.Garmin low-profile Elevate\u2122 optical heart-rate monitor lets you train without a chest strap, and works underwater.Optical heart-rate sensors measure changes in blood volume under the skin, and work best when worn snugly, 1 to 3 finger-widths above your wrist bone.Strava Segment integration lets you know when your starred segment is about to begin, shows instantaneous data of your performance in the moment as well as how it compares to your PR and the current KOM or QOM, and then provides results once the segment is complete.GroupTrack displays the location and telemetry of your contacts using compatible Garmin devices (only works on land).Multisport mode allows for easy transitions between activities within a single workout.Create custom profiles for cycling, running, swimming, etc.Internal accelerometer and gyroscope track speed and distance when you're stationary, like while running on a treadmill.Physiological metrics include VO2 max, lactate threshold (requires a heart-rate chest strap, sold separately), race predictor, recovery advisor and performance indicator.Navigates routes created on Garmin Connect, backtracks your outbound route, or leads you directly to saved waypoints.UltraTrac\u2122 mode reduces GPS recording rate to conserve battery.Integrated Garmin EXO\u2122 antenna for outstanding signal reception from GPS and GLONASS satellites (GPS will not work underwater, but it will note the location you start and finish your dive).Full altimeter, barometer and compass functionality.Daily activity records steps, sleep patterns and everyday essentials.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) via Bluetooth connection to a compatible smartphone.Connect IQ support allows you to download apps, templates, data fields, watch faces and other features. Note: for safety reasons, third-party apps will not work while diving.Automatically syncs activity data to paired smartphones running the free Garmin Connect app.Bluetooth Smart and ANT+ compatibility allows both to be used simultaneously, and syncs with compatible activity sensors.New QuickFit\u2122 strap interface allows for easy strap swaps, in case you need to add the strap extension, want to give your watch a new look, or notice it's time for a thorough clean.Connects to Garmin devices including Virb action cameras, Vector power meters, the Varia radar line and more.In the box: Descent Mk1 with titanium bracelet, black silicone strap, strap extension for use over wetsuits or drysuits, charging/data cable, documentation.",
