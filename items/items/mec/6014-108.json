  "description": "All you need for a nicely packed lunch. When you\u2019re done eating, the kit nests compactly so you won\u2019t lose the lids, and the whole thing straps together with a harness to form a case that floats if it falls out of your canoe. All parts are made with bioplastics made of corn or sugarcane.Kit includes 500ml lid/plate, 900ml bowl, 170 and 320 ml SnapBox, spork, strap and carry bag.Fibre-based materials are safe in microwaves and dishwashers.Plate, bowl and SnapBoxes are bio-HDPE and a sugarcane-based TPE.SnapBoxes have water-tight lids and graduations for measuring.Corn-based co-polyester spork has a serrated edge to do duty as a spoon, fork and knife.Recycled PET CircBag for easy storage.Dimensions are 195 x 185 x 60mm.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
