  "description": "Streamline your market shopping or keep your work outfit from getting rumpled. Easy on-off hardware limits the fuss of coming and going. High-tenacity nylon sheds water to protect your cargo. Clip on the removable shoulder strap to easily carry both panniers into the office. Pockets keep your lock and bike pump separate from your clothes and  reflective accents plus light loops add to your dark-hour safety.Main fabric is water-resistant 400-denier high tenacity nylon.Back panel is 600-denier polyester with a water-resistant embossed TPU coating.Fabrics are highly water-resistant but the bag is not seam-taped, so it's not fully waterproof.Internal backboard keeps the pannier shapely.Rixen and Kaul Modul attachment system has spring-loaded top hooks that adjust to fit rails from 8 to 16mm. A central locking mechanism keeps them in place.Fits racks up to 15cm wide.Webbing and buckle straps secure the panniers to the lower part of any pannier rack.Fold over flap with snag-resistant Velcro closure and an internal draw string closure keeps weather out.Handy magnets keep the drawstring adjustment cord in place as you pedal.Sturdy eyelets allow you to clip in the removable webbing shoulder strap.Large slip-in internal pocket holds a U-lock and a small elastic loop stores your pump.Zippered external front pocket has a key clip.Reflective accents and light loops on both sides enhance visibility.",
