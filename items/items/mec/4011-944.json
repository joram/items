  "description": "Thanks to the non-stick coating, these skillets are excellent for everything from crepes and souffl\u00e9s to powdered eggs. (Using wooden or plastic utensils will increase the life of the non-stick coating.) The bottom is grooved to resist slipping on those less-than-perfectly-level stove sites. The handle folds for transport, and locks into the open position so you can dazzle your trail companions with your pancake-flipping prowess.",
