  "description": "A skinny \u2013 and dry \u2013 workhorse, this 9.5mm line has low impact forces and bantamweight touches for sport, trad and mixed lines. It has a firm hand for easy clipping and a smooth tight sheath that creates less drag through gear and over the rock.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.DeltaDry dry coating is certified to the UIAA Water Repellent standard of less than 5% water absorption. It protects the rope from water absorption, which reduces weight, prevents freezing, and slows down the wear on the sheath to a noticeable degree.High sheath proportion adds durability.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
