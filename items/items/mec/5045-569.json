  "description": "A guide to traversing the Vermont section of the Appalachian Trail. To the north and east, the A.T. crosses short, steep hills and overgrown farmlands that characterize the Connecticut River valley. Farther south is the rugged and rocky high country of the Green Mountains. Each page is centered on the A.T. and overlaps with the adjacent pages so there is little chance of getting lost. A trail profile at the bottom of each page shows the distance between shelters, camping areas, and trail access points.",
