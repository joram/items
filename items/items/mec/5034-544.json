  "description": "Tricams offer some unique features for placing pro. These slung aluminum tripods can be placed like nuts, wedged into place with the sling hanging off the bottom, or they can be placed with the webbing double-backed along the spine, so they cam in place when loaded.Great for tricky placements: flares, horizontals, iced-up cracks, or pockets.Made of hardened aluminum.Stiffer slings than earlier models. Sewn and colour-coded for easy identification.",
