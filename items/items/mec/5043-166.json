  "description": "The ultimate project rope, it's lightweight with smooth handling. Dry Cover treatment on the sheath resists dust and humidity and makes it a smooth running rope.Diameter is  best used for lead climbing, not for top roping or extensive hang-dogging.Unicore construction bonds the sheath and core so there should never be any sheath slippage.Dry Cover treatment on the sheath resists dust, humidity and abrasion and improves handling.Beal plants a tree for every rope sold.",
