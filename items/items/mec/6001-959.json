  "description": "Smoother and easier to use than any other multi-tool, the Free is the next evolution of classic Leatherman utility. Built around an intuitive magnetic retention system, you can access the tools with an easy motion. Simply roll your thumb or finger along the base of the tools, without even taking your gloves off. A new cam-lock mechanism keeps your tools safely locked in place until you\u2019re done.Magnetic architecture means no more nail-nicks and easy access to tools when wearing gloves.Strongest plier head that Leatherman has ever made.Replaceable, and repairable 154CM wire cutter blades.Wharncliffe style straight-edge and serrated-edge knife.Scissors are on the outside of the tool for quick access to one of the most useful tools.20 tools to work through whatever life throws at you.Bronze bushings for smooth opening of exterior blades, with interior elements that rotate individually.All tools lock into place.Contoured and textured handles are grippy and give a nod to the original Leatherman PST.Lanyard ring provides an extra measure of security.Storm grey nylon sheath is exclusive to the Free line and helps you keep your tool close to hand.",
