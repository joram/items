  "description": "If you find traditional sleeping bags too restricting, or too awkward to zip together, this adaptable system for 2 people might be your new favourite thing. The Frontcountry Bed is a modified quilt designed for side sleepers, stomach sleepers, and people who like to stick their feet out. When the temperature drops, you can tuck the sides snugly around you, and on warm nights you can slide your feet out the foot vent to cool off. Sleeping pad sleeves prevent your pads from migrating away in case one of you tends to change positions in your sleep.Durable ripstop shell and soft taffeta lining.Thick synthetic insulation seals in warmth.No zips, toggles, Velcro or cords.Catenary opening is narrower than the width of the bag, so as you push out, the walls push in to seal out drafts.Fits 2 sleeping pads, 51 to 64cm wide, or duo pads.Insulated pockets provide insulation under your arms and allow you to tuck the sides in to prevent drafts, or open up the bag on a warm night.Zipperless foot vent folds closed and can be kicked open when needed.",
