  "description": "A highly evolved and resilient creature. To reduce the risk of cross-loading, the horn prevents assisted locking belay devices from rotating off the top bar and on to the spine. It works with selected pulleys and with standard belay devices too. The Kwiklock gate is quick to open, and locks automatically to eliminate the danger of forgetting to lock your carabiner.Full cross-section of the top bar adds wear resistance and smooth operation when used in auto-locking mode.Clean nose prevents snagging.Kwiklock gate automatically locks when closed.",
