  "description": "Hone your alpine rack by 25% without leaving crucial pieces behind. These breakthrough Ultralight Camalots have less material in the lobes, Dyneema\u00ae slings and Dyneema cord in place of the heavy steel swages. What remains is the dual-axle design, unbeatable range and the opportunity to use them as passive placements.Sculpted cam lobes are the same size and angle as classic C4s.Double axle design offers the widest range for each cam unit, and works in passive placements.Core of the stem uses a continuous loop of braided Dyneema, it's light, strong and spliced to eliminate the need for heavy swages.CNC machined cross bar is light and durable.Ergonomic, symmetrical thumb loop allows  precise placements and fast, no-frig removals.Reinforced trigger wires have a plastic coating to maximize durability.Low-profile 14mm Dyneema sling.",
