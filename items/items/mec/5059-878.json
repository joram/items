Reflective hits add visibility on gloomy days.Made of durable 200-denier nylon with a polyurethane coating.Fully taped seams defy water from reaching inside.3-panel hood has reflective tape, an elastic opening and peaked brim for protection from wind and rain.2 front pockets with flaps keep mittens or snacks dry.Storm flap over zipper with snaps at top and bottom.Elastic cuffs seal out wind.Lots of reflective details for increased visibility.Interior hanging loop.\n\nRelaxed fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nTight, with no room to spare.\n\n\n\n\n\nVery close fit, with a bit of room.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerous, but not oversized.\n\n\n\n\n\nOversized with lots of room for layers.\n\n\nAll MEC men\u2019s and boy\u2019s pants are regular rise.\n\n\n\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
