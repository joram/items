  "description": "For skiers who know not every day is a powder day, here's the most versatile member of Atomic's iconic Bent Chetler line. With a stiff tail to rail on groomers, enough backbone to bust through crud and a slightly spooned tip to float and track through powder, the Bent Chetler 100 is a lightweight quiver-killer suited to both backcountry adventures and regular resort use in high-snowfall regions.Core is made of poplar to bring the weight as low as possible.HRZN Tech spoon-like tip reduces deflection and improves control in powder.Full sidewall construction improves steering.Powder Rocker is 20% rocker in the tip, 10% in the tail, and 70% camber underfoot, to add up to maximum stability in weird conditions and float in deep powder.7000-series sintered bases holds wax very well for a fast glide in any snow conditions.Structured topsheet sheds snow.",
