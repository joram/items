  "description": "For over a decade, renowned travel journalist, bestselling author and TV host Robin Esrock scoured the globe in search of one-of-a-kind, bucket-list-worthy experiences. From the Amazon jungle to the beaches of Zanzibar, The Great Global Bucket List presents a world we don\u2019t hear much about in the news. A world that's strikingly beautiful, thought-provoking, incredibly diverse and sometimes, just very, very funny. With his trademark wit, photography and insight, Esrock introduces the inspiring experiences you\u2019ll be talking and dreaming about for many years to come.",
