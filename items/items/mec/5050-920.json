  "description": "For luxurious front-country camping. This air mattress is the same size as a double mattress, so you can use sheets from home. Air mattresses don't retain a lot of heat, so they're great for summer sleeping. It's thick, with horizontal welds to keep you off the ground and offer a firm sleeping surface, but packs down to a relatively compact size. Durable materials stand up to rough ground and lots of nights out, but it comes with a repair kit just in case.Made of abrasion-resistant 75-denier polyester that meets MEC's environmental standardsInternal TPU laminate has welded seams keep the paid air tight.Internal baffles provide a soft but firm sleeping surface.Dual low-profile valves (one for inflating, one for deflating).Included roll top stuff sack is both a storage bag and a pump sack.Hook-and-loop strap keeps the pad rolled for storage.Repair kit included.",
