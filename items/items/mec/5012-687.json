  "description": "This reusable, non-toxic heat pack is safe even for kids and pets. Depending on the pack's exposure, activation, and use, it will provide heat for approximately 45 minutes to 2 hours.Maximum temperature is 54\u00b0C.Contains water, a stainless steel disc, and food-grade ingredients.Activate by snapping the stainless steel disc and then, as it changes color, knead it to maximize heat and make it last.To reuse, simply boil the pack for approximately 5 minutes. (Microwaving not recommended).Be sure not to let your Reusable Heater Pack freeze. Sub-zero temperatures will permanently affect the internal components, meaning no more toasty heat.",
