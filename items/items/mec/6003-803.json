A Koroyd tip cuts through chatter but keeps you in control on piste or off.Internally milled wood core offers great stability and rebound.Power transfer platform underfoot offers great edging on hard snow.Carbon layer and flax laminate keeps the weight low while increasing the ski's dampness.All-Terrain Rocker 2.0 offers a mix of precision and manoeuvrability.Sandwich construction features ABS sidewall all around the ski for increase durability and strength.5-point sidecut improves steering in mixed snow and feels quick and agile.Koroyd Tip is lightweight and reduces vibration without sacrificing control.",
