  "description": "Wherever your powder-seeking soul takes you, these stiff performance boots want to go too. The Irfran polymer shell provides shock absorption and vibration dampening for extended shredding, booting and more shredding. Ready to shred right out of the box, the liners gradually conform to the contours of your foot, or you can heat-mould them for a lived-in feel on day 1.Cabrio 3-piece shell offers uniform flex and support.MyFit system allows custom moulding of the shell and ID Max Hike liners for optimal fit and performance.Compact ski/hike mechanism combines hike mode with solid and powerful control in ski mode.Forefoot volume can be adjusted with the 4th buckle to match your feet.Adjustable rear spoiler allows you to tweak the forward lean and rear support.GripWalk soles allow nearly-normal walking with a rockered design.Replaceable soles and toe and heel protectors for years of use.",
