    "Windproofness\n\nA windproof garment does not allow any air to permeate the fabric.  A garment with windproof panels has panels of fabric that are totally windproof, but the rest of the garment may not be windproof.  A wind-resistant garment resists some wind, but not as much as a garment that is windproof.": [
