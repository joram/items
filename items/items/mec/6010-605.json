  "description": "Don\u2019t weigh yourself down with more tech. Suunto\u2019s 3 series uses the GPS you\u2019re already carrying (your phone) to collect training data. The free Suunto app lets your phone communicate with your watch to send notifications, reminders and messages. An optical heart rate monitor takes pulse information straight off your wrist, doing away with the need to wear a finicky chest strap. As it learns your current activity level, the 3 provides you with a personalized training plan that offers live updates, letting you know when to go harder or to slow down. It also adapts if you miss a workout, or if you crush it a bit harder than you have before. If a training plan isn\u2019t your style, the 3 series is has 70 different activity profiles. When you're not training, the activity tracker trackd your steps and calories, and monitors the quality of your sleep. It then takes all of your data into consideration when calculating recovery times and tracking progress.Optical heart rate monitor (version 1.2), provides reliable constant heart rate data, and allows you to train without a chest strap, even while swimming!Optical heart rate sensors measure changes in blood volume under the skin, and work best when worn snugly, 1 to 3 finger-widths above your wrist bone.Spot check your heart rate at any point and receive a graph of 10 minutes\u2019 or 12 hours\u2019 worth of heart rate data.
