The Roamer is a self-inflating sleeping pad that has two valves to make micro-adjustments, so you can dial in the perfect firmness. With more than 10cm between you and the ground, it\u2019s plush and cushy, so you and your partner can drift off into dreamland while other campers are still counting sheep.Soft top fabric and durable bottom fabric add strength and comfort where you need it.Open cell, dual-axis foam coring reduces weight and makes set-up easy.Integrated toggles allow you to connect pads. Two Roamer XL Wide pads toggle together to make a queen-sized mattress, so you can use bedding from home.Packs down to half the size of its similarly rated competition.Rated for temperatures from -34\u00b0C and up.Two zero profile valves suck in air for fast set-up, and let you make precise adjustments.Vortex\u2122 high-capacity pump sack makes inflation even faster.One-way dump valve for fast deflating.Includes the Vortex pump sack, a Velcro\u00ae strap, repair kit and duffle storage and transport bag.Covered by Nemo\u2019s lifetime warranty.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
