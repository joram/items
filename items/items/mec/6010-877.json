  "description": "This compact multi-tool blends a pocket knife with a bartender\u2019s friend. With a true 2-stage corkscrew the Armbar Cork reduces the chances of spilled vino. By adding the 2-stage lever to the opening process you get another layer of finesse and the result is much smoother than the standard pocket knife corkscrew, where pulling carefully is your only option. Bundled into the compact package with the 2-stage corkscrew is a locking blade, scissors and a few other tools that will make everyday life a little easier.420HC blade is easy to sharpen and holds an edge well.Liner-lock design keeps fingers safe when using the knife.2-stage bottle opener makes for smooth opening.Compact spring loaded scissors for those cuts a knife isn\u2019t right for.Fold-out backspacer contains a bottle opener and a compact prybar.",
