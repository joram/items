  "description": "A prime combination of function, strength, and lightness. They're the first wire gates to use a spring mechanism similar to the ones found on standard gates. This type of mechanism lasts twice as long as the usual wire-gate setup, and has smooth gate action that feels similar to the popular Petzl\u00ae Spirit.Strength of 22kN with closed gate, 10kN with open gate, 7kN if cross-loaded.Gate opening of 2.6cm.Monofil (single wire) gate offers a hybrid of wire gate and standard gate design.Notchless nose won't catch on stuff.H-shaped profile is thicker on the inside, for durability and smooth rope handling.CE certified.",
