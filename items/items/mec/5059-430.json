  "description": "The closest thing to climbing barefoot, but better. Offering finger-like grabbing ability and designed for maximum toe sensitivity, the Furia S is ready to grip whatever you\u2019re sending. An Integral Power Rib adds structure for precisions and adaptability, while the microsuede fabric supports your movement but doesn\u2019t loosen over time.Non-stretchy microsuede ensures a consistent fit over time.Long, narrow IPR (Integral Power Rib) strap runs from the toe to heel to provide structure to the shoe.Rubber-wrapped forefoot adds security on technical toe hooks and scums.Aggressive downturned design is ideal for steep routes and boulder problems.1mm Flexan midsole with a floating big toe pad adds slight support without losing sensitivity.Dual pull-loops at the heel.Vibram\u00ae XS Grip 2 rubber provides exceptional friction and sensitivity.Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size.",
