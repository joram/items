  "description": "Level up on dicey seams and dime-thin edges with this precise, yet forgiving shoe. This intermediate-level design has a low-profile toe, close-fitting heel and tensioned rand that allows you to push down and find purchase on small edges and fading cracks. Split leather and microfibre upper provides a slipper-like fit that feels surprisingly secure and \"locked in\" once you crank down the double straps. Zenith Pro rubber holds an edge confidently and lets you stick like a bug on slab routes and faith-based smears.Leather and microfibre upper balances comfort and performance.Padded tongue for forefoot comfort when jamming.Double Velcro\u00ae closure for quick on and off.Anti-deformation midsole holds its shape even after hundreds of pitches.Sticky Zenith Pro rubber holds to even the smallest edges.Members typically downsize 1.5-2 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size.",
