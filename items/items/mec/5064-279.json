  "description": "The secret of lightweight packing: carry items that have more than one use. This modern A-frame tent uses your trekking poles for support. It's as roomy as a classic model, but takes advantage of today\u2019s featherlight fabrics to produce a stable shelter without the weight penalty of a full metal frame.Single wall design with vents under the eaves to circulate air and reduce condensation.Poles can be rigged inside or outside the tent.2 oversized storage pockets along walls keep your essentials close at hand without encroaching on your living space.All seams are sealed with waterproof tape that is free of solvents, PVCs and VOCs.Set-up requires 2 trekking poles (not included).8 superlight aluminum J stakes included.",
