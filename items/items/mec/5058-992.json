  "description": "Kids who spend every waking moment on the slopes need warm, waterproof snow pants. Waterproof face fabric with sealed seams keeps legs dry, and synthetic insulation keeps them warm on long descents and windy chairlift rides. Extendable cuffs plus an adjustable waist with a hook-and-loop closure mean these pants will last through a growth spurt or two. Ankle gaiters wrap snugly around boots to keep all that powder on the outside where it belongs.Face fabric is 100% polyester.Waterproof-breathable and fully seam sealed.Synthetic insulation is warm and water-resistant.Adjustable waist with hook-and-loop closure.Zip fly.Ankle gaiters with grippy elastic cuffs keep snow out.Cuffs are reinforced at hem, with abrasion-resistant kick patches on inner legs.Cuffs can be extended by 2in. to accommodate growing legs.Reflective logo on front of pants.",

    "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.  Values under 8,000g/m2/24h provide low performance, 20,000g/m2/24h provide moderate performance and values over 30,000g/m2/24h provide high performance.": [

    "Fabric waterproof rating\n\nThe standard test for waterproof fabrics uses a standing column filled with water.  The figures given are the water column height.  A rating of 3,500mm or higher can be considered waterproof.  The higher the rating, the more durable the waterproof fabric will be over time.": [

A wind-resistant garment resists some wind, but not as much as a garment that is windproof.": [
