  "description": "McNett\u2019s seam sealer cures to a flexible urethane rubber, sticks well, and lasts a long time. It also works well as an adhesive to glue on repair fabrics. Moisture speeds curing. Use sparingly as a thin film for best effectiveness. Store in the freezer once opened.Comes in a 1oz. squeeze tube.Note: will not successfully adhere to silicone-treated fabrics.",
