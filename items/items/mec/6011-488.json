  "description": "When Knog first wanted to build the Cobber line, 18 factories told them it couldn\u2019t be done, Knog persisted and the result is dazzling. Using chip on board (COB) LEDs the Cobber line creates a wall of light, like a screen, but way brighter. This set adds a lot of visibility without adding a lot of weight, only 39 grams per light. With USB charging and multiple modes, it's a worthwhile addition to your kit.330\u00b0 viewing angle keeps you seen.Efficient COB LEDs maintain brightness for up to 90% of the battery\u2019s capacity.Magnetic mount lets you attach your light to the base with little more than a magnetic click.Mount base includes multiple different sized o-rings for mounting to bars, posts, stays, or even your head tube (up to 20cm circumference).Free ModeMaker app lets you customize your light\u2019s modes.8 different modes including: steady (high and low), pulse, flash (standard, rolling, side, disco and eco).Front light is 320 lumens and the rear light is 170 lumens.IP67 waterproof design means that if you are willing to ride in it, the Cobber will keep shining.Simple 1-button interface lets you cycle through modes with a short press or lock the light (so it won\u2019t turn on in your bag) with a long press.Integrated USB plug (type-A) means you don\u2019t need to tote around a cable to charge your light.LED battery status light lets you know when it\u2019s time to charge.Easy USB charging means there are no longer any reasons to have dim light.",
