  "description": "This bundle pairs the Edge 1030 Plus with 3 powerful sensors to help you get the most out of your training. Sensors track speed, heart rate and cadence on the go, or at home on your trainer. It includes free detailed maps for nearly every region in the world. With double the internal storage of its predecessor, you get phone-free turn-by-turn routing, course creation and round-trip routing for nearly anywhere on the planet. When connected to the Garmin Connect\u2122 app, features like Trendline\u2122 show you the most popular routes, anywhere Garmin users ride. Real-time Strava segment integration displays nearby segments, showing how you compare to your PR and the current KOM or QOM. Live Tracking now displays not only where you've been but also where you are going. Through Garmin Connect, you can receive texts, social media alerts, emails, download training plans and personalize daily workouts, review activities ot keep an eye on the weather.Intuitive touch-based interface and an upgraded processor allow fast and easy movement between training, navigation, activity profiles and Connect IQ apps.Free global maps, with North America included and more regions downloadable from Garmin Express, for turn-by-turn routing to local points of interest.Point of interest navigation lets you search for places like restaurants, attractions, hospitals, accommodation and more.Trendline\u2122 routing uses Garmin Connect\u2019s database of rider\u2019s routes and tracks to find popular routes.ClimbPro\u2122 mode shows grade, total ascent, remaining ascent and elevation profile.Mountain biking dynamics include 3 new metrics, jumps: number of jumps, hangtime, distance and speed, grit: overall trail difficulty, and flow: a score of how smoothly you rode the trail.TrailForks\u2122 integration for access to TrailForks trail database without a cell connection.Strava Segment integration (requires premium) preloaded or on-the-fly through your phone, shows starred segments and instantaneous results as segments end.LiveTrack share your course with contacts.GroupTrack displays the location and telemetry of  contacts using compatible Garmin devices.Find my Edge feature alerts you with location and exact GPS coordinates. Once in Bluetooth\u2122 range you can trigger an alarm on your device to find it.Training plan takes you through the details of your ride: weather \u2013 including the recommended clothing for the conditions, food and water requirements based on your fitness levels \u2013 even providing reminders of when you should drink and eat, and much more.Environmental factors like heat and altitude acclimation are taken into consideration when calculating performance and recovery metrics.Training status and daily suggested workouts help you optimize your training, guiding you where you need to push and where you may need to dial it back.Incident detection uses accelerometers to detect accident and uses you phone to send a signal to predefined emergency contacts.Bike alarm mode sounds a loud, attention-getting alarm if your bike is touched when you park it.Connects to GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations and multiple networks for fast connection and a strong GPS signal.Connect IQ support allows you to download apps, templates, data fields, and other features.Soft (ANT+ & Bluetooth) chest strap is comfortable and accurate.Speed and Cadence sensors use Bluetooth\u2122 and ANT+\u2122 transmission technology.Speed sensor tracks rides, even when you aren\u2019t using your phone or Edge computer. Sensor starts when you start rolling or stop, synching that ride to your phone (running Garmin Connect) or computer when in range.Sensors attach with no magnets or exposed parts, making them easy to install, maintain and move between bikes.Speed Sensor attaches to a standard hub on either wheel and self-calibrates for accurate speed and distance while stationary (on a trainer) or on the move.Cadence Sensor fastens to any crank arm size and measures pedal strokes per minute.Barometric altimeter helps you track your ascents, descents, and total elevation changes.Physiological metrics includes VO2 max estimate, lactate threshold, race predictor, recovery advisor and performance indicator (requires included heartrate chest strap).Imports activity profiles, custom screens and all sensors used in the past year, from previous Edge models, making set-up easier than ever.In the box: Edge 1030 Plus, HRM Dual heart rate sensor, cadence sensor, speed sensor, mounts (standard and extended out-front), USB cable, tether and manuals.",
