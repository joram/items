  "description": "A durable pack with crossover potential. Use it for gear-intensive trips to tag summits, or for pared-back overnight backpacking. With the Kyte 36's robust harness, you can carry up to 18kg. Use the attachment points to add sleeping equipment and rig the pack for backpacking or mountaineering. No matter what you put inside, the LightWire\u2122 frame transfers weight to a comfortable spacer mesh harness and hipbelt. This suspension system ensures all-day carrying comfort, especially in warm conditions when the mesh back panel provides airflow around your torso.Made of durable fabrics that stand up to sandstone canyons and alder-filled bushwhacks. Base and high-wear areas use abrasion-resistant nylon packcloth.Peripheral frame and framesheet effectively transfer the load to the hipbelt and spread the weight across the entire back panel.Mesh covered ridged foam back panel provides ventilation and keeps the load close to the body.Women's specific height-adjustable harness lets you dial in the fit for your torso length.Access the pack interior via the top drawstring or side zipper.Bottom zippered compartment provides a dedicated home for your sleeping bag.Stretch-mesh front and side pockets let you stash gear on the fly.Zippered side, hipbelt and lid pockets provide secure storage.Dual tool loops with bungee tie-offs carry ice axes.Stow-on-the-Go trekking pole attachments let you stash your poles without removing the pack.Side compression straps cinch in the load.Bottom sleeping bag straps, front daisy chain and lid webbing loops let you lash on extra gear.External access hydration sleeve makes refilling easy and protects pack contents from spills.
