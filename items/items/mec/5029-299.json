  "description": "A revolution in auto-locking design, this carabiner uses 2 independent magnetic arms in the gate and a steel insert in the nose to lock it closed. Opening it requires 2 independent actions, but you can do it with your right or left hand. It may sound dodgy, but the mechanism is actually super-secure.Symmetrical design makes it easy to operate with either hand.Smooth gate operation, and it's not prone to freezing.",
