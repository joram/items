  "description": "Small and bright enough to be useful almost anywhere. Great for travel, camp chores or just looking in the crawlspace. With a big lumen boost, this version of the Tikka is better than ever.Single LED casts a wide even beam, best for proximity lighting.Red LED preserves night vision and won't disturb tent mates.Single button cycles through 3 brightness settings and red mode.Light dims gradually, rather than suddenly dimming and going dark.IPX4 water proofing resists splashing or light rain.Glow in the dark ring aids finding it in the dark.Compatible with CORE rechargeable battery pack and Ni-MH rechargeable batteries (neither included).",
