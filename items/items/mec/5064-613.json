  "description": "A cozy option for little adventurers who experience the outdoors by carrier, ski sled, or bike trailer. Warmer than fleece and less bulky than a snowsuit, the versatile Bundle Up is a lightly insulated, DWR-finished one-piece suit that can be worn solo, or as a mid-layer with something like the Newt Suit. Double zipper entry allows for easy in-outs and diaper changes, and insulated foldable paws make for toasty feet and hands.Shell and lining are recycled polyester with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish.Insulated with 100g PrimaLoft Black Eco recycled polyester to keep little ones warm.Convertible mitts and slippers provide feet and hands with an extra layer of insulation against the elements.Insulated hood has an internal elastic to seal in heat.Gusseted crotch reduces any ride-up, and helps accommodate diapers and baselayer onesies.Hand-me-down ID label.Can be washed in cold water and dried on gentle settings. Don't use fabric softeners, bleach, dry cleaning.Generous fit for seasons of use.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
