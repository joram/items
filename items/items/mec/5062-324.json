  "description": "The Madrid is the most venerable model in the Birkenstock family, and a true classic. Whether you pair them with a thick wool sweater and jeans, or something dressier, they deliver the same flexible shock-absorbing base. Arch support and a deep heel cup cradle you through every step, because feeling good at sunset dance parties never goes out of style.Durable synthetic leather upper is soft against the skin and holds its shape.Slip-on style with single strap that opens if you want.Suede-lined, anatomical cork footbed cushions and insulates for comfort.Footbed edge is slightly raised to protect your feet from toe-stubbing.Toe bar guides your toes into place and promotes natural steps.EVA outsole for lightweight durability and absorbing shocks.",
