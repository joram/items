  "description": "Nature-deficit disorder isn\u2019t a medical condition \u2013 it\u2019s a description of the human costs of being alienated from nature. There are solutions, though, and they\u2019re right in our own backyards. The author brings together research that shows how exposing children to nature is essential for healthy physical, emotional, and spiritual development. Parents have the power to ensure their kids won\u2019t be the last child in the woods, and this book is a step toward reuniting children with nature.",
