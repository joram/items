  "description": "Snug as a bug in a rug... as long as the bug is you and the rug is the Space Cowboy +7C Sleeping Bag. The Reflective ThermaCapture lining harnesses body heat to keep you warm in the backcountry without weighing you down. A zoned design keeps your sleeping situation just right, giving you extra insulation on top where you need it and less on the bottom where your sleeping pad has you covered. Synthetic fill stands up to morning dew, so you can \"cowboy camp\" under the stars without a tent.Synthetic eraLoft\u2122 is efficient, compressible polyester that dries fast and retains warmth when wet. Hollow fibres reduce weight without sacrificing warmth.Zoned design provides maximum insulation where it's needed \u2013 on top. Your sleeping pad insulates you on the bottom, so the bag has less fill there to save weight.Reflective ThermaCapture\u2122 lining traps radiant body heat to provide additional warmth without adding grams.Removable SynergyLink\u2122 connectors integrate to your sleeping pad to prevent slippage. 2 elastic bands fit around pads up to 64cm wide.Quilt loops let you customize your sleep system by attaching a Therm-a-rest quilt or blanket over top to add even more warmth.Stuff sack and storage sack included.",
