  "description": "A replacement filter for Pristine Water Bottles. Most filters use a membrane to screen out the micro-organisms and parasites. This system uses a sintered polymer matrix that traps microorganisms, but provides less resistance to water, so you don't need a pump to push water through.Removes 99.9% or greater of cryptosporidium and giardia lambia.Removes sediment, organic debris, and chlorine taste.Each filter treats up 380L (depending on water quality).Pristine Water Treatment may also be added to the water for treatment against bacteria and viruses.",
