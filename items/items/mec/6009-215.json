  "description": "A skinny workhorse, this 9.5mm line has low impact forces and bantamweight touches for sport and trad lines. It has a firm hand for easy clipping and a smooth tight sheath that creates less drag through gear and over the rock.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.High sheath proportion adds durability.Bi-colour pattern indicates middle.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
