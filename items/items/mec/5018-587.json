  "description": "Ever looked down at your belay device to find the attached carabiner cross-loaded beween the rope and the belay loop? The Belay Master offers a significant safety improvement by offering a pivoting catch that locks down on the gate and keeps the carabiner properly aligned. In addition, it can only be engaged once the carabiner is locked, so it acts as great reminder. The carabiner is a nice medium size, with a large rope radius and soft angles.I-beam construction is strong and light.Clean nose prevents snagging on the belay loop or device.Screw gate must be manually engaged.Can be used without the catch, which twists off if you don\u2019t want it.",
