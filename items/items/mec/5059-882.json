  "description": "For those days where the cold comes at you from every angle, a little extra parka goes a long way. The Long Toaster Parka keeps the youngest members of the family warm and comfortable, and that is in everyone\u2019s best interest. Thoughtful details include soft trim around the neck and pockets, reflective piping, zipper pulls that can be grabbed with mittened hands, and insulation that's tapered in the arms, so movement isn't limited.Shell is abrasion-resistant 150-denier 2-layer polyester with a polyurethane waterproof breathable laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish. Seams are not taped, so this garment will not be fully waterproof in heavy rain.Soft recycled polyester lining glides over layers.Insulated with 300g insulation in the body to keep the body core warm, and 240g insulation in the arms and hood for freedom of movement.Reflective trim in strategic locations increases visibility.3-piece hood has internal elastic to seal in heat and snaps closed with a pair of stealthy snaps.Fleece-lined collar helps keep the cold out and leaves plenty of room for a scarf.Front zipper has an insulated storm flap with hook-and-loop closure.Elasticized cuffs keep out cold and snow.Dual layer pockets have a larger pocket that is ready for stashing toques and gloves, with a smaller zippered pocket overtop.Name tag on the inside, great for making play date or daycare pick-ups a little easier.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
