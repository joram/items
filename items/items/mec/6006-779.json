  "description": "Fully featured for alpine excursions, this lightweight harness is ready to send. With 5 large gear loops and 2 ice screw slots, you can rack all your cams, nuts, and screws, and still have room for a piton or two. The waist and leg loop buckles undo completely so you don't have to worry when putting it on over skis or crampons. The waist belt and leg loops are padded and distribute weight evenly, so it's just as comfortable at the crag as it is in the mountains.Soft Frame construction distributes loads evenly and packs down small.3D mesh padding provides lightweight comfort.Dyneema protector and wear-indicator on tie-in points add durability and show red threads when excessively worn.Slide Block buckles allow the waist belt and leg loops to be fully opened.5 gear loops and 2 ice screw attachment points provide plenty of racking options.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product",
