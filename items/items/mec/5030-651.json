  "description": "Great for watersports, these bags are also light and supple enough to use for backpacking.Supple fabric lies flat and is easily packable.Secure them using the lash points on the bottom. You can also fashion shoulder straps by adding webbing to the lash points and D-ring closures.Welded strips seal the roll-top closures.Note: these dry bags do not provide submersible waterproof protection or impact protection. For electronics, we recommend hard cases with gasket seals.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPVC Free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      PVC free",
