  "description": "Bites fast and chews in quick. The shape of the drilling teeth is designed to bite in about a quarter turn, so you can get your screws started rapidly. The integrated crank applies efficient leverage to wind them in with one hand even at awkward angles. A smallish hanger is easier to place in sculpted ice, but big enough to grip with gloves or cold fingers.Shaft is treated stainless steel, hanger is aluminum.Colour-coded cranking handles make identification easier.Swivelling crank on the hanger allows fast placement and removal.Sharpening reserve on the teeth helps with filing.",
