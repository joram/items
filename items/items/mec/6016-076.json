  "description": "If you find traditional sleeping bags too restricting, this adaptable system might be your new best friend. The Backcountry Bed is a modified quilt designed for side sleepers, stomach sleepers, and people who like to stick their feet out. When the temperature drops, you can tuck the sides snugly around you, and on warm nights you can slide your feet out the zipperless foot vent. If you tend to change positions as you sleep, the sleeping pad sleeve prevents your pad from migrating away over the course of a night.Shell and lining are lightweight 20-denier polyester.650-fill-power duck DriDown is treated so it absorbs less moisture, retains loft and dries 33% faster than untreated down.No zips, toggles, Velcro or cords.Catenary opening is narrower than the width of the bag, so as you push out, the walls push in to seal out drafts.Stretch cord system allows you to clip the integrated comforter to the sides of the bag to keep it tucked in, even when you toss and turn in your sleep.Insulated pockets provide insulation under your arms and allow you to tuck the sides in to prevent drafts, or open them up on a warm night.Zipperless foot vent folds closed and can be kicked open when needed.Half-length sleeping pad sleeve fits sleeping pads 51cm wide.Women's-specific cut is slightly shorter and offers more room in the hip area.",
