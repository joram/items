  "description": "Whether you need to assist your partner past a difficult section, or rappel down a multipitch route with an injured climber, you owe it to yourself and your fellow climbers to be prepared. Self-Rescue fully describes and illustrates techniques that every climber needs to know for safety and self-reliance. Revised with the latest techniques and accompanied by Mike Clelland's clear illustrations, this is the definitive resource on the topic. It includes self-rescue concepts: terrain, technical ledges, baseline and belay escapes, knots and hitches, anchors and belays, assessment of patients and terrain, top-rope rescue, leader rescue, and search and rescue.",
