  "description": "Trust your instinct. Garmin knows that instinct is usually all that separates a great story from a bad day. The rugged new Instinct GPS Watch helps stack the deck in your favour and is another tool to help get you home safe. A powerful, internal antenna connects 3 different satellite constellations: GPS, GLONASS and Galileo. Multiple networks, combined with satellite position caching, give you a fast connection and a strong GPS signal wherever you are. Built-in navigation tools let you navigate to saved coordinates, follow courses you've created in Garmin Connect, or just find your way back to the car. The Instinct pairs GPS data with the onboard accelerometer to provide training metrics like speed and distance information. The latest Elevate optical heart rate monitor reads your pulse information straight off your wrist, so there's no need to wear a chest strap. Multiple sport profiles add custom metrics to your training data, letting you train smarter for all your activities. Pair the Instinct with the free Garmin Connect\u2122 app on your phone to review activities, set up live tracking sessions, monitor real-time weather forecasting, receive notifications, control apps and much more.Connects to GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations for fast signal acquisition and a strong connection nearly anywhere.Satellite caching allows your Instinct to save satellite data so it knows where to look for them when you turn it on, giving you a fast and accurate satellite signal in any terrain.Tilt compensated 3-axis electronic compass shows your heading even when you're stationary, so you're always facing the right direction.Barometric altimeter helps you track your ascents, descents and total elevation changes.Storm alarm tracks pressure changes and alerts you when it\u2019s time to find shelter. Extended weather data can also come in via the connection to your smartphone.Extend battery life by selecting different GPS modes to find the perfect balance of GPS accuracy and time until your next recharge.UltraTrac\u2122 mode reduces the GPS recording rate to conserve battery life, allowing you to stay in the field longer (up to 40 hours).Built-in activity modes for hiking, biking, running, strength training (with rep counter), walking, swimming (indoor only) and more. Each activity has a fully customizable display.Pre-loaded and customizable workouts help you hone your training, plus you can even race past activities.Move IQ intelligently detects your activity and tracks it in your Connect timeline to ensure you get credit for all of your daily exercise.Course navigation via created or downloaded courses.Breadcrumb trails track your trek, navigate you to a saved location or entered coordinate (there are no maps for routing), or navigate you on the trail you took back to where you started.Internet Live Tracking during activities (through a connected smartphone) allows you to share your location and heart rate with friends, family or coaches.Equipped with Garmin\u2019s new lower profile Elevate\u2122 optical heart rate monitor which provides more reliable constant heart rate data and allows you to train without a chest strap.Optical heart rate sensors measure changes in blood volume under the skin, and work best when worn snugly, 1 to 3 finger-widths above your wrist bone.Broadcast of your HR over ANT+ (so other devices can pick it up).With 24/7 activity tracking, Instinct learns your activity level and helps guide you towards a more active lifestyle.On-board sleep-tracking mode monitors your rest, letting you see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep in your Connect profile.Counts flights of stairs with internal barometric altimeter data that\u2019s combined with your step data.Weekly intensity minutes are displayed against the ideal of 150 needed to maintain a healthy life.Automatically sync your data to paired smartphone running the free Connect app.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) via Bluetooth connection to a compatible smartphone.Compatible with all smartphones featuring Bluetooth 4.0 (iPhone 4S or higher, and Android 4.3 or higher).Connects with ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart sensors, from foot pods to speed and cadence pods (but not power meters).Customizable display lets you set up your screen the way you want it, displaying what is most important to you.Customizable button setups let you program \u201chot-keys\u201d, setting long-presses of buttons to take you directly to certain modes or perform certain actions.Rugged construction with MIL-STD-810G certification for thermal, shock and water resistance (100m).User-friendly strap changes (compatible with QuickFit bands).Rechargeable lithium-ion battery lasts up to 14 hours in GPS mode or 14 days as an activity-tracking smartwatch.In the box: Instinct charging/data cable and documentation.",
