Deep ribbed grooves let you use it with a wide range of ropes: skinny alpine floss to fat top-roping cords. Use it in autoblock mode to belay 2 following climbers. The release slot allows it to be released easily while under load.  Ideal for guides, alpine climbing and multi-pitch rock routes.Grooved slots provide efficient braking and smooth handling.Auto-blocking mode allows simul-belaying of 2 seconds from above.Release slot is large enough to fit a carabiner to release it under load.Recommended for use with 7.7 to 11mm diameter ropes.",
