  "description": "Carry your VHF radio while kayaking, canoeing or sailing. This case protects your potentially life-saving gadget from wetness, and lets you operate the radio while it's in the case.Made of UV-stabilized polymers that don't break down or discolour in sunlight.In direct sunlight, the air inside a transparent case heats up and causes condensation, to reduce this use desiccant packs.High-frequency welded seams are as strong as the surrounding material.Accommodates left or right antenna.Includes an adjustable lanyard.Submersible to 5m and floats if dropped.Aquapac\u00ae does not guarantee the items inside the case, only the case itself. Likewise, MEC's Rock Solid Guarantee covers the product, but not the contents.",
