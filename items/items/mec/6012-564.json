  "description": "The secret weapon for climbing technical masterpieces. This micro-edging machine is slightly wider in the forefoot and narrower in the heel than it's predecessor. The PAF heel system reduces pressure on the Achilles without sacrificing a snug fit. The midsole curves slightly up the outside of your foot, providing support while staying thin and sensitive. A great option for routes demanding edging power and precision.Microsude uppers with ceramic reinforcements in high wear areas.Alcantara fibres in the toe area mould to your foot.PAF heel system distributes pressure over the heel for a comfortable fit.Curved 1mm Flexan midsole provides support on small footholds.3.5mm XS Edge rubber outsole grips tiny edges.Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size.",
