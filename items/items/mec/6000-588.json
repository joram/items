  "description": "Keep your gear dry on the trails, in the boat or on your rainy commute. Building on the success of the Nano line, the X-Hail includes a low-profile purge valve, making packing faster and easier.Supple fabric lies flat and is easily packable.X-Hail umbrella valve lets air out, without letting anything else in.Rectangular base helps the bags stay upright while packing and unpacking.D-ring at roll-top.Welded strips seal the roll-top closures.PFC-free DWR finish.Note: these dry bags do not provide submersible waterproof protection or impact protection. For electronics, we recommend hard cases with gasket seals.",
