  "description": "Get your downhill thrills in this helmet with a custom dial fit that\u2019ll feel like it was made for you. An active vent system lets heat out but prevents snow from getting in. Hopefully disaster never strikes, but if it does, you\u2019ll be prepared with MIPS and EPS 4D foam that absorbs more impact than a standard EPS helmet.EPS 4D foam is designed to absorb more impact than standard EPS construction.MIPS helps with the reduction of rotational forces in the event of a crash.In-Mold construction blends durability and lightness.Custom Dial Fit system makes for a precise and comfortable fit.Active ventilation system regulates airflow by opening or closing vents. Grids prevent snow entry.AdvancedSkin ActiveDry liner helps manage moisture and is removable and washable.Merino wool in the liner keeps you cozy when storms are in full swing.Earpads are audio system compatible.",
