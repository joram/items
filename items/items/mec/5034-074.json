  "description": "This MiniMaglite has always been tough, now it has an LED in place of a bulb, that pumps out an amazing amount of light. Power settings let you choose between dazzling brightness for finding camouflaged outhouses and a discrete glow for reading in bed.Anodized aluminum body is knurled for a non-slip grip.Reliable rotary on/off switch provides a focusable beam and eliminates a potential point for water entry.Both ends sealed with O-rings to resist rain and splashes..",
