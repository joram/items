The fabric is highly water-resistant, comfortably breathable, and stretches to let you plough through puddles.Fabric is circular knit for 4-way stretch, laminated to a non-porous hydrophilic film for water resistance.DWR treatment enhances water repellency and breathability.Seams are not taped.Elastic waist with drawcord.Articulated knees for a great fit and ease of movement.Ankle zips have reflective trims for night-time visibility.Back pocket has an invisible zipper.\n\nRegular rise\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nGarments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use. For example, cycling clothing is longer in the back and arms. Activity aside, the fit of MEC clothing falls into these categories:\n\n\n\n\n\nOur next to skin fit that contours the body for no distractions\n\n\n\n\n\nOur close to body fit with a low profile silhouette for ease of movement\n\n\n\n\n\nOur standard, slightly off body fit for unrestricted comfort\n\n\n\n\n\nOur roomy, off body fit for maximum comfort and easy layering\n\n\nAll MEC men\u2019s and boy\u2019s pants are regular rise.\n\n\n\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
