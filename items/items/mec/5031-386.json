  "description": "Sensitive shoes for dancing up steep sport routes and working moves on your training wall. They have good rubber coverage that lends itself to involved footwork and tricky hooking tactics. A bi-tensioned randing system keeps weight centered over the toe, but doesn't cram your foot forward.Durable Lorica\u00ae leather uppers.Rubber toe patch provides toe-scumming and hooking power.Slightly asymmetric, curved shape for precise foot placement.Vibram XS Edge rubber is designed to grip through friction moves.Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size.",
