  "description": "Developed in collaboration with Tommy Caldwell, this light, skinny rope can handle the rigours of big-wall free climbing and tough redpoints. The sheath is braided on a machine with 48 bobbins, making it supple, with great hand-feel and abrasion-resistance. UIAA certified EcoDry treatment absorbs less than 2% of it's weight in water, so it stays light and is less susceptible to freezing in wet, cold conditions.ColorTec sheath pattern change provides a permanent middle mark.Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating.EcoDry finish makes this rope durably water-repellent and dirt-resistant without the use of PFCs.3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product",
