  "description": "An ultralight double rope for adventures on rock, ice and snow. The Alpine Dry Rope is based on Mammut's Phoenix rope, for use them on convoluted pitches and full-length rappels. You can also use it as a single line for glacier travel or ski tours.Dry treatment on both sheath and core protects against water and dirt.Coated yarns allow individual fibres to glide over each other, reducing internal friction and fully utilizing each yarn when loaded, for extra durability.Comes lap-coiled by the factory, so ready to climb.Specs shown are for use as a half rope.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material",
