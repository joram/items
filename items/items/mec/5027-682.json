  "description": "Tech webbing is super-thin, super-strong webbing that has a braided polyamide sheath and a Dyneema\u00ae core. Dyneema is light material with high tensile strength, but it abrades rapidly and its slipperiness does not hold knots well. The addition of a polyamide sheath increases the stability and safety of knots and hitches.This product is sold by the metre.Dyneema core has a polyamide (nylon) sheath, kernmantle woven with the core to increase the stability of knots.Diameter is 12mm.Breaking load is 15kN.Weight of 22g/m.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
