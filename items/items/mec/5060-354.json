Arrange it as needed and slumber sweetly.Wide 15cm baffles channel the insulated side\u2019s warmth around your body.Shell is recycled polyester with a DWR finish to shed water and dirt.Lined with a soft recycled polyester twill.Insulated with synthetic MEC Hyperloft Eco polyester insulation that's 50% recycled fibres.Zipper has anti-snag tape along its full length, making zipping easier and helping to keep a little extra warmth in.Integrated zippered stuff-pocket doubles as a pocket, keeping important items close to hand.Hang loops make airing out your sleeping bag easy.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
