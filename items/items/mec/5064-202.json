  "description": "A rack-pack of wire gate carabiners that come with a twist: they have two-part gates that combine the lightness of a wire gate with the snag-free design of a keylock closure. The open gate strength of 11kN inspires confidence should it slip into a compromised position.KeyWire hybrid wire gate with keylock closure.Notchless nose won't catch on gear.I-beam construction and a curved spine contribute to a high open-gate strength.Includes 6 carabiners in colours that match most cams for easy identification and racking.",
