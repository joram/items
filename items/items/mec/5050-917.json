  "description": "Sleep warm without weighing down your pack. The VectAir Insulated LT Sleeping Pad uses PrimaLoft Gold synthetic insulation with Cross Core Technology that adds aerogel to polyester filaments. Translation: you get exceptionally light insulation without extra bulk, so the pad folds down small in your pack. Inflation is a breeze, thanks to the included pump sack.Made of lightweight brushed polyester with an internal TPU laminate and welded seams to keep the pad air-tight.Internal mylar film reflects heat back to you.Offset dot welds eliminate cold spots.Low-profile recessed valve creates a smooth sleeping surface.Roll-top pump sack inflates quickly and has enough extra room to store a compact pillow or sleeping clothes.Hook-and-loop strap keeps the pad rolled for storage.Includes a repair kit.",
