  "description": "A protective landing zone that's easy on the backside and on the wallet. Four inches of foam provides solid impact protection, and the durable outer material withstands being dragged around the boulders. Square corners fit well with other pads to eliminate dead space in pad stacks.Tough 900-denier nylon is polyurethane-coated for water resistance.Combination of high and low compression foam makes for a crashzone that cushions without bottoming out.Padded shoulder straps and large waistbelt for transporting it to the crag.Hinged design with 3 metal buckle closures is easy to pack.",
