  "description": "Amply sized for day hiking or bikepacking, the Tempest 24 gets you off the grid without weighing yourself down. A ventilated back panel and harness keep the load close to your body for comfortable carrying, and let air in to cool your back, while the continuous-wrap hipbelt stabilizes your load to keep you balanced on rocks and logs, or while hauling groceries.Mesh-covered die-cut foam hipbelt, shoulder straps and back panel are lightweight and let air flow.Women\u2019s-specific design features a shorter torso length, shoulder straps that are set closer together and a hipbelt shaped to fit curvier hips.Seamlessly integrated lumbar pad and hipbelt transfers weight without rubbing.Stretch-mesh pockets on the shoulder strap, hip belt, and sides are easy to access on the go.Stow-on-the-Go trekking pole attachment lets you stash your poles without taking off your pack.External hydration sleeve accommodates a 3L reservoir (sold separately) and is easy to load and unload without opening the main compartment.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
