  "description": "Paddle with piece of mind \u2013 your essentials will stay dry if the SealLine Skylake Dry Daypack takes an unexpected dunk. It's big enough for a day trip, and has padded shoulder straps to make portages more bearable. The bag flattens, rolls up and stays closed with a strap for tidy storage.Made of rugged polyester and nylon, polyurethane-coated on both sides with welded seams for lasting waterproofness. PVC-free.DrySeal\u2122 roll closure is highly water-resistant (though not waterproof through indefinite submersion).Lightly padded shoulder straps are comfortable when carrying loads, and are removeable for travel.External stretch mesh pocket holds items and acts as a grab point if it goes for a swim.Rolls up and secures with pocket strap when not in use.",
