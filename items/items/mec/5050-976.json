  "description": "Tackle any terrain with ease. Recessed wheels and a telescoping handle let you glide through airports and train stations, while cushy straps make it a breeze to shoulder the load when your hostel is 1km away down cobblestone streets. Small enough to fit in most airplane overhead bins, the Rolling Continent Carry On Pack is a versatile piece for travellers who never want to check a bag. Although extensive field testing for durability, including tossing it down stairs and bouncing it around a baggage carousel, means you won't have to worry if you need to gate-check.Made of durable and water-resistant 600-denier polyester.Internal/external metal frame and light foam padding add structure, so it sits like a suitcase and protects your souvenirs.Zip-off panel covers the shoulder straps when you're in rolling mode and stows in a dedicated pocket when you're in backpack mode.Telescoping handle with a push button and recessed wheels make rolling easy.Padded, contoured shoulder straps make for comfortable carrying.Dimpled foam back panel allows air circulation.Large panel opening to the main compartment has a spill gate to allow overstuffing and locking zipper heads for added security.Two zippered front pockets keep your keys, passport and documents close at hand.Main compartment has a large mesh zippered pocket under the lid and 2 compression straps with buckles.Padded top and side handles make the bag easy to grab off baggage carousels or overhead bins.",
