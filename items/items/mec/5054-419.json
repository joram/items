  "description": "There\u2019s no need to tread lightly. These off-trail boots are designed to haul heavy loads. Vibram\u00ae Star Trek outsole sticks where you strike and won\u2019t give out during downhill braking. A \u00be rand gives you durability with elastic rubber and a beveled edge that doesn\u2019t catch or peel \u2013 so they stand up to many backcountry miles. Built-in GORE-TEX\u00ae booties provide waterproofness with breathability.Uppers are nubuck leather, treated during tanning to ensure water resistance.Gore-Tex Performance Comfort membrane is thermo-sealed into a bootie then fixed to the upper and glued to the midsole.Removable footbeds have a quick drying top fabric that wicks away moisture, a layer of active carbon, a cushioning layer, and small holes that aid breathability.4mm PE insoles control flexibility and distribute load.Thermal moulded EVA midsoles include 2 densities of TPU inserts for stability and comfort.\u00be rubber rand is edge beveled for greater durability.Vibram\u00ae Star Trek rubber outsoles excel in steep technical terrain for grip and braking.",
