When travelling light you can hold the wire end loops in your thumbs or insert scavenged sticks into the loops as handles for more sustained use. For even more comfort there are two moulded plastic grips included.Includes tin, hooks and handles.Packed in a handy storage can (handles do not fit in can).",
