  "description": "A classic shape that's nice and stable. The larger pieces have scoops on the concave face and cut-outs on the convex face that seat well around irregularities and let you work them in shallow placements. Their transverse taper gives you options for flaring cracks too. All in all, a versatile piece of pro.Rounded edges facilitate removal.Colour-coded anodized heads match other Wild Country\u00ae pro.Numbers 1 to 6 are hot forged, 7 to 11 are extruded.",
