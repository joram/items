  "description": "Beat the crowds to the viewpoint. With enough room to carry the 10 essentials and then some, the Tempest 40 takes you through dawn-to-dusk missions and minimalist overnights. A ventilated back panel and harness keep the load close to your body for comfortable carrying, but let air in to cool your back. The continuous-wrap hipbelt stabilizes your load to keep you balanced on rocks, logs and ridges, and Stow-on-the-Go trekking pole attachments make it easy to go hands-free on scrambly sections.Mesh-covered die-cut foam hipbelt, shoulder straps and back panel are lightweight and let air flow.Seamlessly integrated lumbar pad and hipbelt transfers weight without rubbing.Top-loading access to the main compartment underneath the removable lid.Additional side zipper entry into main compartment.Bottom zipper provides quick access to your sleeping bag.Stretch-mesh pockets on the shoulder strap, hip belt, sides and front are easy to access on the go.Stow-on-the-Go trekking pole attachment lets you stash your poles without taking off your pack.External hydration sleeve accommodates a 3L reservoir (sold separately) and is easy to load and unload without opening the main compartment.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
