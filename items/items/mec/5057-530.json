  "description": "Because empty bottles are a waste of space. The Stash is there when you need it, barely there when you don\u2019t. A firm top and bottom keep it upright when it\u2019s full.  When it\u2019s empty, the soft TPU body packs down to nearly nothing and provides excellent puncture resistance. Perfect to keep in your gym bag or daypack.Made from BPA free, PVC free TPU.Naturally anti-fungal.63mm opening fits most standard water filters.Moulded top and bottom with custom snap-fit storage feature.Collapses to 5cm.",
