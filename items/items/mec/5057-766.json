  "description": "A versatile cord for multi-pitch adventuring or ice missions. 9.4 hits that sweet spot of light enough for hard redpoints, but substantial enough to spend time working your project.Dry treatment on both sheath and core protects against water and dirt.Sheath has a 2x2 weave to withdstand everyday use.Comfortable handling that knots easily and feeds smoothly.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.Large middle mark is convenient when rigging rappels and belaying for long routes.",
