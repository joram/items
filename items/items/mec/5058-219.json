  "description": "A backpack for trips by boat, bike or boots where everything NEEDS to stay dry. The Nano 30 Dry Pack is made with the same fully waterproof fabric and roll-top closure as the MEC Nano Dry Bags. We added simple backpack straps to make it easier to get from the trailhead to the peak, the farmer's market to your front door or the boat launch to lunch.Made of lightweight 70-denier nylon with a waterproof thermoplastic polyurethane laminate.Welded construction and roll-top closure keep out water.Shaped air mesh shoulder straps provide ventilation and dry quickly.Buckles at the bottom of the shoulder straps let you clip them on to canoe yokes, kayak decklines or SUP D-rings.Note: This pack does not provide submersible waterproof protection or impact protection. For electronics, we recommend hard cases with gasket seals.",
