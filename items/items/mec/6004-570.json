  "description": "With a lumen boost over the last Tikkina, it's now better than ever. Whether in camp, around home, or evening bouldering, this little headlamp is compact enough to keep with you, and bright enough to find many uses.Single LED casts a wide beam that's best for proximity lighting rather spotting things over distance.Simple 1-button design easily cycles through the 3 brightness settings.Light dims gradually over the burn time rather than suddenly dimming and going dark.IPX4 water proofing means the light keeps shining even when Mother Nature has other ideas.Compatible with CORE rechargeable battery pack and Ni-MH rechargeable batteries (neither included).",
