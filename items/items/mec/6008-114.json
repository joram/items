      "Yes"
    ],
    "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.  Values under 8,000g/m2/24h provide low performance, 20,000g/m2/24h provide moderate performance and values over 30,000g/m2/24h provide high performance.": [

    "Fabric waterproof rating\n\nThe standard test for waterproof fabrics uses a standing column filled with water.  The figures given are the water column height.  A rating of 3,500mm or higher can be considered waterproof.  The higher the rating, the more durable the waterproof fabric will be over time.": [

    "Windproofness\n\nA windproof garment does not allow any air to permeate the fabric.  A garment with windproof panels has panels of fabric that are totally windproof, but the rest of the garment may not be windproof.  A wind-resistant garment resists some wind, but not as much as a garment that is windproof.": [
