Adapters for vehicle and wall outlet are available separately.Generates enough chlorine solution to treat 200L of water in one 5-minute cycle.Default power source is a 12-volt battery (connected via included alligator clips).One fully charged 12-volt battery provides enough power to treat 40,000L of water.Can also be powered by car and wall outlets using adapter kits (sold separately).Easy to follow 1-page image-only instructions.White indicator light and sound signals communicate the progress of electrolysis. Coloured lights indicate power source or brine concentration issues.Includes starter salt for brine-mixing, test strips to ensure proper concentration and a carrying caseIncludes measuring cup (for treating 200L barrels) and measuring spoon (for treating 20L cans).Chlorine container (included) to store treatment solution for up to 24 hours, to treat water that's remote from the chlorine maker and its power source.Tested and validated in low-resource settings, including communities in Kenya, Mali, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Thailand.",
