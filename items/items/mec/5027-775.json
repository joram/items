  "description": "The Ropeman 2 makes a great alternative to prusiks or heavier ascenders. It is essentially an incomplete ascender until you add a locking carabiner to it. The carabiner acts as the spine against which the cam presses the rope. The version has a steel cam and forged side plates. It's a touch lighter than earlier versions, and the internal radii gives it smoother function with different types of carabiners and skinny cords.Stainless steel cam, aluminum side plates.Forged side plates work with a range of carabiner types and shapes.Works with ropes from 8 to 13mm.4kN strength.CE certified.",
