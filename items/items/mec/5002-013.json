  "description": "Tested in some of the worst bug-infested areas in the world, for protection against deer ticks, mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects. While many bug repellents are alcohol-based, Ben\u2019s uses a water-based formula. This means less evaporation and less absorption of DEET into the pores of your skin. Plus, it reduces the possibility of skin and eye irritation and is much less flammable.37ml spray bottle.Product contains 30% DEET.",
