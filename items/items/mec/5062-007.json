  "description": "When Adam Shoalts ventured into the largest unexplored wilderness on the planet, he hoped to set foot where no one had ever gone before. What he discovered surprised even him. Shoalts was no stranger to the wilderness. He had hacked his way through jungles and swamp, had stared down polar bears and climbed mountains. But one spot on the map called out to him irresistibly: the Hudson Bay Lowlands, a trackless expanse of muskeg and lonely rivers, caribou and wolf \u2013 an Amazon of the north, parts of which remain unexplored to this day.Gripping and often poetic, Alone Against the North is a classic adventure story of single-minded obsession, physical hardship and the restless sense of wonder that every explorer has in common. Shoalts\u2019s story makes it clear that the world can become known only by getting out of our cars and armchairs, and setting out into the unknown, where every step is different from the one before and something you may never have imagined lies around the next curve in the river.",
