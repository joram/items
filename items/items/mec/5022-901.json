  "description": "Particularly on a short-roofed car, paddlecraft tend to project unsecured beyond the straps of even the best roof racks. At highway speeds, that puts a great deal of twisting torque on the whole system. These little gizmos let you create lash points further forward and/or aft, for greater stability. Simply open your hood or trunk, position the loop with the loop emerging through the gap, and close.Sold in pairs.Webbing is 2.5cm wide, 23cm long.Not for use in Subarus or other vehicles that have frameless car doors.",
