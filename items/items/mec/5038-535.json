  "description": "The Ryder Strider Sunglasses have a rimless design that vents moisture and allows unobstructed views at any angle, even when you're dropped down low over the bars.Fits small to medium faces best.Frames are thermoplastic for durability, flexibility, and lightness.Injection moulded lenses reduce distortion and limit eye fatigue.Anti-slip nose pads keep the glasses in place and stick even better as your face gets wetter.Some colourways have Photochromic lenses that change with the conditions, ensuring you always have the right tint.Some styles are treated with a military grade anti-fog material to keep you fog-free. Anti-fog lenses perform at their best when clean. Simply wash the lenses with water and they\u2019ll keep your vision clear. When not in use, anti-fog lenses are happiest stored in a warm, dry environment.",
