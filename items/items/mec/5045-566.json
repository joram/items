  "description": "A guide to traversing the northern Maine section of the Appalachian Trail. This section  through Maine offers some of the most challenging sections of trail along the A.T., both in rugged terrain and weather conditions. Katahdin in Baxter State Park marks the A.T.'s northern terminus and for many hikers it also marks the end of a months long journey. Each page is centered on the A.T. and overlaps with the adjacent pages so there is little chance of getting lost. A trail profile at the bottom of each page shows the distance between shelters, camping areas, and trail access points.",
