  "description": "This insulated parka helps you combat the wet, dark days of winter. When you're venturing out to celebrate the winter solstice or just keeping warm at the bus stop, the waterproof shell sheds sleet or rain, and the  insulated hood shields your ears from blowing snow.Waterproof-breathable coated nylon, seams are not taped so water could sneak in if it\u2019s raining hard.Lined with recycled polyester that glides over layers.Insulation is synthetic Hyperloft that's 50% recycled.2-way front zipper has a storm flap to eliminate drafts.Hood is fully insulated.Lots and lots of pockets.Button-adjustable cuffs have hidden reflective details: invert the reflective band to go incognito or leave it exposed for nighttime visiblity.Drawcord at hem helps seal out cold.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",

    "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.  Values under 8,000g/m2/24h provide low performance, 20,000g/m2/24h provide moderate performance and values over 30,000g/m2/24h provide high performance.": [

    "Waterproofness\n\nWaterproof garments use waterproof-breathable technologies and are fully seam-taped.

      "Waterproof without taped seams"

A garment with windproof panels has panels of fabric that are totally windproof, but the rest of the garment may not be windproof.  A wind-resistant garment resists some wind, but not as much as a garment that is windproof.": [
