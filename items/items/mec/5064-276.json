  "description": "One of the key things that makes winter camping great, is a really warm sleeping bag. Using recycled polyester insulation, the Sunbeam series keeps you warm and offers great value. With the Big Agnes\u2019 System, you don't have to worry about rolling off your pad in the middle of the night. An integrated sleeve holds the pad against the bag, and by doing away with insulation on the bottom of the bag, it reduces overall weight and bulk. The cut of the Sunbeam is roomier than a traditional mummy bag, but the  weight is comparable to a narrower cut bag. Designed to fit the contours of a woman\u2019s frame, it offers a thermally efficient and incredibly comfortable night\u2019s sleep in the backcountry or weekend campsite.Shell is lightweight nylon with a water-repellent finish.Lining is soft polyester microfiber.FireLine\u2122 Eco insulation is 100% post-consumer recycled polyester. Tightly woven fibres provide high-loft, compressibility, plus a high weight-to-warmth ratio.Flow\u2122 construction uses horizontal baffles to create tunnels of warmth that wrap around your body, and to prevent the insulation from shifting.Draft flap behind the zipper, yoke and draft wedge at the connection between the pad and the bag ensure cold air doesn't sneak in.Sleeping pad sleeve has stretch panels to fit different pads. Petite fits  51\u201364 x 168cm. Regular fits 51\u201364 x 183cm.Since there's no insulation on the bottom, for best results, use with pads that have an R-value of 4 or more.Free Range Hood lets you move your head, even when fully zipped.Hood has a one-hand adjustment.Built-in pocket keeps a pillow in place.Interior loops for attaching a bag liner.Hang loops let you air it out in the sun.Includes a mesh storage bag and a nylon stuff sack.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content",
