  "description": "Timeless. This fleece is nice and simple so it works as a mid-layer to wear under a rain jacket or ski shell. On its own it takes the chill off campfire nights or leaf raking duties. It has classic style and even a bit of a retro nod, but the brushed polyester is entirely warmth-without-weight modern.Soft, brushed  mid-weight polyester fleece with an anti-pill finish.Front zip with chin guard.2 hand pockets store small items.Elastic edge binding on collar, cuffs and hem seals out drafts.Curved hem provides a bit more rear coverage.Internal name label ensures it won't get misplaced at school or camp.\n\nRegular fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use.
