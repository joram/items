  "description": "A compact cooking kit that is great for a romantic meal under a full moon or a belly-filling chilli with your climbing partner. The light materials and nesting design of the Dualist Cook Set make it easy to carry for an overnight trip or a longer adventure.Set includes a 1.8L pot with strainer lid, two 590ml insulated cups, two 590ml bowls, two Sip-It lids, two telescoping foons, a stove bag and stuff sack.Pot is made from Halulite\u2122, a hard anodized aluminum alloy that conducts heat evenly, is abrasion resistant and has a scratch-proof Teflon coating.Pot features a double rolled rim, and folding handle that locks into place for cooking and secures the set for transport.Nylon lid has an integrated strainer and heat-proof silicone rim. Put the lid on during transport to prevent the pot from getting crushed.EVA insulated polypropylene mugs and bowls nest together, colour-coded for identification.Welded stuff sack doubles as a small sink or wash basin.Pot holds a 220g canister, a small folding LPG stove and the included dishware. (Note: stove and canister are not included.)",
