Beneath the Venu SQ\u2019s clean lines lies a powerful smartwatch and activity tracker. Using the latest generation Elevate\u2122 optical heart rate monitor, your pulse is taken from the back of the watch. Heart rate information is used for tracking calories, stress level, fitness age, and more. Internal GPS and accelerometers track training metrics like speed and distance, turning movement into data, making sure you get credit for your work in the gym and on the trails. When you need a little personal time, follow along with a mindful breathing exercise to get your day back on track. Pairing the Venu SQ with the free Garmin Connect app opens a whole new set of features, you can review activities, receive notifications, track the weather, control phone apps and much more. From 24/7 heartrate monitoring, to personalized training plans, the Venu SQ helps you understand how your body handles to every day life.20+ activity modes, including: biking, running, walking, swimming (indoor only), strength training (with rep counting), yoga, Pilates and more.Breathwork mode uses mindful breathing exercises to help you relax and focus.Respiration tracking keeps an eye on your breaths per minute, both while asleep and awake.Garmin Coach provides free, personalized training plans for your first 5k, to improve your next 10k, or just to train smarter.Move IQ intelligently detects your activity and tracks it; so, you get credit for all daily exercise, from taking the stairs at work, to catching an evening spin class.Body Battery\u2122 tracks your daily energy levels, monitoring what drains your energy (exercise) and recharges your energy (rest, food, etc.), giving you a better idea of how and when to train.Garmin Pay\u2122 contact-less payment, lets you make payments with your watch (if supported by your bank).LiveTrack\u2122 during activities (through a connected phone) allows you to share your location and fitness data.Incident detection uses the connection to your phone to send an alert in the case of an accident, letting your emergency contacts know where you are and that you need help.Assistance mode sends out a message with a LiveTrack link, letting your contacts know where you are.Connects to 3 different satellite constellations (GPS, GLONASS and Galileo) and caches satellite positions, for a fast connection and a strong signal nearly anywhere.Elevate\u2122 optical heart rate monitor has a red LED for Pulse Ox data and even works while swimming.Stress level score monitors heart rate variability while inactive.  When stress levels are high, the Venu will guide you through a relaxing mindful breathing exercise.Menstrual tracking, log physical and emotional symptoms and learn about training and nutrition during each phase of your cycle.24/7 activity tracking learns your activity level and guides you towards a more active lifestyle.On board sleep tracking mode monitors your rest, letting you see your breathing patterns, total sleep hours and periods of movement and restful sleep.Automatically syncs your data to paired phone running the free Connect app.Connects with ANT+ sensors, from foot pods, to speed and cadence pods (no Bluetooth sensor support).Connect IQ support allows you to download apps, templates, data fields, watch faces, and other features.Internal GPS provides basic waypoint navigation.Back to start feature directs you (as the crow flies) to where you started your activity.3.3cm liquid crystal colour display is crisp and clear in any light.Corning\u00ae Gorilla\u00ae Glass 3 helps keep you screen scratch-free.Intuitive touchscreen and 2-button interface.Easy strap changes, thanks to quick-release pins.",
