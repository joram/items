Co-developed by Tommy Caldwell, as a high-end powerful shoe, the mid-height cut protects your ankles and strategically placed foam helps make long splitters endurable if not comfortable.Uppers are leather for fit and durability. Vibram\u00ae rubber rands provide good friction in cracks.Synthetic lined uppers, (unlined under the foot for comfort and sensitivity). PU foam protects your feet while jamming.Airmesh tongues for breathability.P3 tensioning system directs power over the toes and forefoot.Slip-lasted construction with a 1.1mm Laspoflex midsole for stiffness and power when edging.Outsoles are Vibram\u00ae XS Edge\u2122 rubber which is more durable and edges better than XS Grip\u2122 rubber.La Sportiva suggests downsizing 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from your street shoe size.",
