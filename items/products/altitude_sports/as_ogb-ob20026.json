The wood pulp is dissolved in a closed-loop process with a non-toxic organic solvent, then the solution is forced through tiny holes in order to create a magical biodegradable fiber that feels softer and lighter than cotton", "Ethically made: Made in better working conditions with living wages, no child labor, freely chosen employment and respect for the environment", "Soft + Breathable: TENCEL\u2122 is softer, more breathable and more absorptive than cotton because it is composed of very small fibers. The end result feels like something closer to silk than cotton - which is definitely a good thing."]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1230/9376/products/OGB-OB20026_7EDusty_20Rose.jpg?v=1625296539"]}
