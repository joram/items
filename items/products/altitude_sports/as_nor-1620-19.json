Extremely light and soft, it was originally developed by the US Army to replace natural down. As down absorbs moisture, it becomes wet and loses its thermal-insulating abilities. PrimaLoft\u2122 absorbs three times less water, is 14% warmer when dry and 24% warmer when wet, than the competitive insulation.\n                            \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n"}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1230/9376/products/NOR-1620-19_7ECaviar_0ff66bc7-7e61-4222-be7a-9bcf8e2de83c.jpg?v=1580542445"]}
