Swiss-designed and beautifully crafted, the Cloudventure employs an innovative outsole to provide outstanding cushioning, grip and energy return on trails. The secret to the CloudTec\u00ae outsole is 11 distinct pods that compress when loaded, then spring back when you toe off. This unique structure provides cushioning on the horizontal plane as well as the vertical and works to offset the impacts of sustained downhill running. The outsole is overlaid with a thin speedboard that evens out the shoe's flex and supports a natural rolling foot motion. Up top, a 100% waterproof and breathable upper provides comfort and protection when the weather turns. A luxe interior is comfortable from the get-go, and protective toe-and-heel bumpers offer extra confidence when things get technical.Upper membrane is 100% waterproof and highly stretchy.Cushioning EVA midsole.Integrated speedboard imparts a natural flex, provides energy retuen and doubles as a rock plate.Unique CloudTec\u00ae pods compress and stretch upon impact to provide cushioning, improved grip and energy return.Micro-engineered grip rubber features multiple extruded textures to provide traction exactly where it's needed.", "product_code": "5062-522", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["480g (7)"], "Ideal for": ["Trail running"], "Feel\n\n'Minimal and natural' shoes offer low drop, lots of flex, and minimal cushioning. Most running shoes are 'Light and responsive' with medium cushioning and good energy return.
