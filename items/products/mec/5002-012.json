While many bug repellents are alcohol-based, Ben\u2019s uses a unique water-based formula. This means less evaporation and less absorption of DEET into the pores of your skin. Plus, it reduces the possibility of skin and eye irritation and it's much less flammable. The unique 177ml (6oz.) Eco-Spray bottle uses compressed air instead of propellants such as hydrocarbon or fluorocarbons that may damage the environment. It also provides total separation of propellant from the product, which means less waste and more effective protection.Product contains 30% DEET.Made in USA.", "product_code": "5002-012", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["177g"], "Ideal for": ["Alpine climbing and mountaineering", "Travel"], "Picaridin\n\nAn odourless alternative to DEET; suitable for people with sensitive skin.": ["0%"], "DEET\n\nThe active ingredient in many bug repellents.
