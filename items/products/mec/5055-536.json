While it might be skinny, the Fusion Photon offers the right balance between diameter and weight. Its shorter length ability to be clipped as a half or twin, suit glacier and alpine travel and ski touring.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.DeltaDry dry coating is certified to the UIAA Water Repellent standard of less than 5% water absorption. It protects the rope from water absorption, which reduces weight, prevents freezing, and slows down the wear on the sheath to a noticeable degree.Specs shown are for use as a half rope.When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands):\nDynamic elongation: 32.3%\nStatic elongation: 6.5%\nImpact force: 8.7kN\nUIAA fall rating: 16", "product_code": "5055-536", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["1.68kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Half", "Twin"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
