The Yeti 3000X gives you portable power \u2013 anywhere. Lightweight lithium batteries offer on-grid convenience without any of the fumes or noise of a generator. Wi-Fi integration lets you use the free Yeti app to check charge and discharge rates, turn ports on or off, monitor temperatures, update firmware and much more, from anywhere you have a signal. Or, if your phone isn't within reach, find the same information in the onboard digital display. With a full suite of charging ports, you can charge or run almost anything, from power tools out in the field, to an actual fridge in your camp kitchen.Upgraded 2000W AC (3500W surge) inverter can power even the most power-hungry household devices.Wi-Fi lets you control the Yeti 3000X remotely, so you can check charging and discharging status, update firmware, turn ports on or off, and much more.LCD power status display for power use, battery charge capacity and time remaining under current load.Charges via included wall charger, going from 0 to full in 14 hours, or 6-72 hours from a compatible solar panel (bigger and more efficient panels take less time).MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) technology enables more efficient charging via solar panels in low-light conditions.Li-NMC (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide) battery offers a longer life than standard lithium-ion batteries and better inherent safety, and they're lighter than lead-acid batteries.Battery can be kept plugged into a power source during storage, or fully charge your Yeti 3000X Lithium every 3-6 months and store in a cool, dry place.Included Yeti cart makes moving your power from A-to-B a whole lot easier.Peak capacity is 3032 Wh (10.8V, 280.8Ah) and lasts through hundreds of cycles.Smart management system provides charging (solar or mains) and low-battery protection built-in.4 USB ports (output): 2 x type-A at 5V, up to 2.4A (12W max), 2 x USB-C 1 at 5V, up to 3.0A (18W max), and 1 at USB-PD spec 5\u201320V up to 3.0A (60W max), all ports are regulated.6mm port (output): 12V, up to 13A (120W max).12V car port (output): 12V, up to 13A (120W max).12V power pole port (output): 12V, up to 30A (360W max).AC inverter (output, 60Hz, pure sine wave): 120VAC 16.5A (2000W, 3500W surge).Provides pass-through power, so you can plug your Yeti into the wall and then your device into your Yeti to make sure your device stays powered should the power go out.Charging port (input, 8mm):14-50V, up to 10A (150W max).Power-pole charging port (input): 14-50V, up to 50A 600W max).Expansion port in the storage compartment, for use ONLY with Goal Zero modules.Storage compartment keeps cables and adapters close and where you need them.Operating temp is 0-40\u00b0C.Includes a Goal Zero Yeti 3000X Lithium Power Station, Yeti Cart and a wall charger.Do not attempt to charge your yeti lithium from a 12v source with anything but the yeti 12v car charging cable (sold separately).
