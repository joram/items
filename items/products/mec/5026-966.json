It fits better. It clips on more securely. Adjust it to the right length for the job, then fix it there with an easy wrap-and-lock motion. No slack. No tug-of-war. Carbiner-style clips keep the bungee \u2013 and your cargo \u2013 in place more reliably than open hooks. Plastic top caps clip to the cord itself to prevent loose, flappy ends.Durable, high-quality cord won\u2019t lose its stretch over time.Two sizes: Small, 5mm cord that adjusts from 15-71cm; and Large, 9mm cord that adjusts from 25-122cm.", "product_code": "5026-966", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["40g (Small)"], "Ideal for": ["Car camping"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815516909598/5026966-GRY00.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815517040670/5026966-GRY00-ALT-DETAIL.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815516909598/5026966-GRY00.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815517040670/5026966-GRY00-ALT-DETAIL.jpg"]}
