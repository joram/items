It offers a balance of durability and weight to suit sport, trad or multipitch lines. A firm in-hand feel makes clipping easy and smooth.All-around features suit cragging or multi-pitch climbing.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.Tight sheath reduces drag through gear and over rock.", "product_code": "6000-648", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.72kg (60 Meter)", "4.34kg (70 Meter)"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing"], "Type": ["Single (9.9mm - 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath. Dry (UIAA certified) ropes have both core and sheath treated, plus meet the UIAA Water Repellent standard by passing a stringent test where a soaked rope cannot absorb more than 5% of the rope's weight.": ["Non-dry"], "Length": ["80m (80 Meter)", "60m (60 Meter)", "70m (70 Meter)"], "Dynamic elongation\n\nMaximum elongation in the first UIAA test fall, where a weight is attached to the rope and then dropped.

Higher numbers indicate stretchier ropes.": ["8.6%"], "Impact force\n\nThe amount of force, in kN, that the first UIAA fall puts on the falling object.
