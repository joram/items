Tap into the power of the sun, to power through any adventure with potentially infinite battery life. By connecting to multiple satellite networks and caching last known satellite positions you get a fast connection and a strong GPS signal. The GPS nearly doubles the watch\u2019s battery life and navigation tools let you save coordinates, follow courses created in Garmin Connect\u2122, or just find your way back to the car. GPS data combined with accelerometer data gives you training metrics like speed and distance.Power Glass\u2122 solar panel lets you go longer between charges, 8 hours to 48 days longer \u2013 runtime is feature dependent.Sun gauge displays solar charge and daily sun exposure.Connects to GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations.Satellite caching saves satellite data, for fast, accurate satellite signal in any terrain.Tilt compensated 3-axis electronic compass shows your heading even when you are stationary, ensuring that you are always facing the right direction.Barometric altimeter tracks ascents, descents and total elevation changes.Storm alarm tracks pressure changes and alerts you when it\u2019s time to find shelter. Extended weather data can also come in via the connection to your smartphone.Power manager uses pre-set and custom power profiles to balance battery life and GPS accuracy.Battery saver mode offers almost unlimited battery life, with solar power and limiting functionality.Built-in activity modes for hiking, biking, running, strength training (with rep counter), walking, swimming (indoor only) and more.Pre-loaded and customizable workouts, you can even race past activities.Move IQ detects and tracks activity; it appears in your Connect timeline to credit all your daily exercise.Course navigation, via created or downloaded courses.Breadcrumb trails track your trek, navigate you to a saved location or entered coordinate (there are no maps for routing), or navigate you on the trail you took back to where you started.Internet Live Tracking during activities (through a connected smartphone) allows you to share your location and heart rate with friends, family, or coaches.Elevate\u2122 V3 optical heart rate monitor has a red LED for Pulse Ox data and even works while swimming.Broadcast of your HR over ANT+ (so other devices can pick it up).Body Battery\u2122 tracks daily energy levels, monitoring what drains your energy (exercise) and recharges your energy (rest, food), letting you train smarter.24/7 activity tracking, Instinct learns your activity level and helps guide you towards a more active lifestyle.Sleep tracking mode monitors rest, periods of movement and restful sleep in your Connect profile.Counts flights of stairs with internal barometric altimeter data combined with step data.Weekly intensity minutes displayed against the ideal for health of 150.Automatically sync data to a smartphone running the Connect app.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) via Bluetooth connection to a compatible smartphone.Connects with ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart sensors, from temperature pods, to speed and cadence pods.Customizable display lets you set-up your screen how you want it.Customizable button set-ups program \u201chot-keys\u201d, setting long-presses for certain modes or actions.Rugged construction with MIL-STD-810G certification for thermal, shock and water resistance (100m).User-friendly strap changes (compatible with QuickFit bands).Fits wrist circumference of 132-224mm.Solar rechargeable lithium-ion battery lasts up to 38 hours in GPS mode, or 54 days as an activity tracking smartwatch, or indefinitely \u2013 with 3H of daily sun exposure.In the box: Instinct Solar, charging/data cable and documentation.", "product_code": "6011-865", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["53g"], "Ideal for": ["Running, fitness and training", "Swim training", "Camping and hiking"], "Face material\n\nPolycarbonate is inexpensive and light, with good clarity and wear-resistance.
