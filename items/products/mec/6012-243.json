Designed from the ground up for side sleepers, the Sidewinder uses an innovative cocoon pattern to get you a great night\u2019s sleep. Dual-layer quilting wraps your body in cozy FireLine\u2122 Eco recycled synthetic insulation. And, the blanket like hood has hand pockets in the corners, so you can tuck yourself in just like you would at home.Shell is lightweight nylon, lining is soft polyester microfiber, and both have a water-repellent finish.FireLine Eco insulation is composed of 100% post-consumer recycled polyester. Low denier fibres are tightly woven to provide high-loft, compressibility, a high weight-to-warmth ratio and durability.Cocoon design keeps side sleepers cozy by keeping insulation close to the body.Horizontal baffles create tunnels of warmth that wrap around your body, and prevent insulation from shifting and creating cold spots.Draft flap behind the ambidextrous, anti-snag locking zipper ensures cold air doesn't sneak in.Optimized footbox mimics the natural position of your feet when lying on your side.Hood lets you lift and move your head, even when fully zipped up and has a one-handed cinch adjustment.Hang loops let you air it out in the sun.Includes mesh storage bag and nylon stuff sack.Women's version is wider at hip, narrower at shoulders, with extra insulation at chest and feet.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n.st0{stroke:#333;stroke-width:.79;stroke-miterlimit:10}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content", "product_code": "6012-243", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["1.22kg (Regular Right Zip)", "1.13kg (Petite Right Zip)"], "Ideal for": ["Car camping"], "Length": ["Fits up to 5' 10\" (177 cm) (Regular Right Zip)", "Fits up to 5' 5\" (165 cm) (Petite Right Zip)"], "Capacity\n\nThe number of average sized people that the product can comfortably sleep.": ["1-person"], "Temperature": ["-2\u00b0C"], "Shape": ["Mummy"], "Insulation": ["Synthetic"], "Technology": ["FireLine"], "Construction": ["Offset quilt"], "Face fabric": ["Nylon ripstop"], "Lining/backer": ["Polyester"], "Packed size": ["22 x 23cm"], "Shoulder girth": ["147cm (Regular Right Zip)", "142cm (Petite Right Zip)"], "Hip girth": ["140cm (Regular Right Zip)", "135cm (Petite Right Zip)"], "Foot girth": ["94cm (Regular Right Zip)", "89cm (Petite Right Zip)"], "Yoke\n\nAn insulated collar that covers yours neck and shoulders to reduce heat loss.": ["No"], "Additional feature(s)": ["Stuff sack included", "Home storage sack included", "Draft tube behind zipper", "DWR-treated shell fabric", "Interior pocket(s)"], "Product sustainability": ["Recycled content"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160512667678/6012243-PLL05.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160764882974/6012243-PLL05-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160764948510/6012243-PLL05-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160512667678/6012243-PLL05.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160764882974/6012243-PLL05-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160764948510/6012243-PLL05-ALT-SIDE.jpg"]}
