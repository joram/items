Aramid fibres, braided into the sheath and core, have high cut-resistant properties for great durability when rappelling over edges. In the event of a fall, these aramid fibres will break, allowing the core of the rope to absorb the impact. Great for glacier travel, hauling, and full-length rappels.Made from a combination of high-strength polyamide and aramid.Designed to be used as a tag line, for hauling and rappelling.Pro Dry finish makes this rope durably water repellent and dirt resistant.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling.Tested for two falls used as a twin rope with CE EN 892.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material", "product_code": "6006-776", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["2.03kg (70 Meter)"], "Ideal for": ["Snow and ice climbing", "Rock climbing"], "Type": ["Static"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
