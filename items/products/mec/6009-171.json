It has a firm hand for easy clipping and a smooth tight sheath that creates less drag through gear and over the rock.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.DeltaDry dry coating is certified to the UIAA Water Repellent standard of less than 5% water absorption. It protects the rope from water absorption, which reduces weight, prevents freezing, and slows down the wear on the sheath to a noticeable degree.High sheath proportion adds durability.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material", "product_code": "6009-171", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.54kg (60 Meter)", "4.13kg (70 Meter)"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
