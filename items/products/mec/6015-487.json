The IonR 9.4mm is a high-performance rope that's substantial enough for cragging, without weighing down your pack on long approaches. The new XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments. The good balance of strength, versatility, and dry technology make it a great option for projecting to desert tower adventures to waterfall ice.XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments.Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material", "product_code": "6015-487", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.99kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
