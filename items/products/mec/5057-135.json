But they're MEC staff favourites because they truly translate from activity to life. Gathered cuffs and a mid-rise smocked waist look as good with a tank top and flip flops as they do with a hydration pack and day hikers.Made of ripstop nylon and spandex, with recycled content. Durable water repellent (DWR) finish provides weather protection against unexpected showers.Pull-on, drawcord-style elastic waist with faux fly.2 deep front pockets.Double-layer of fabric at knees for extra durability for climbing or kneeling in a canoe.Gusseted crotch gives you range of motion to reach for footholds, sink deep into yoga poses or bound over fallen logs.Tapered fit with a trim cuff at the ankle.\n\nRegular fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nTechnical garments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use.
