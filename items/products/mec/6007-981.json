For extended top-roping sessions you may want to choose a thicker, workhorse rope.Dry treatment on both sheath and core protects against water and dirt.Coated yarns allow individual fibres to glide over each other, reducing internal friction and fully utilizing each yarn when loaded, for extra durability.Comes lap-coiled by the factory, so ready to climb.High sheath percentage increases durability.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material", "product_code": "6007-981", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["4.13kg (70 Meter)"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
