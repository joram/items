Updated with a new resin compound, the B03S lasts up to 40% longer than the previous generation (B01S). Compared to metal pads, the resin compound is quiet, generates less heat, and offers more progressive stopping power (no sudden braking). The only compromise? Resin has a shorter lifespan than metal, especially under wet conditions.Comes with 1 left and 1 right pad, and 1 spring for 1 set of brakes.To replace both front and rear brakes, you will require 2 sets of these brake pads.Compatible with Shimano BR-C501, BR-M575, BR-M525, BR-M495, BR-M486, BR-M485, BR-M475, BR-M465, BR-M447, BR-M446, BR-M445, BR-M416, BR-M416A, BR-M415, BR-M4050, BR-M3050, BR-M395, BR-M375, BR-M365, BR-M355, BR-M315, BR-T675, BR-T615, BR-TX805, and BR-MT500 disc brake calipers.Also compatible with TRP Spyre, Tektro Dorado HD-715, Orion, Gemini, Auriga, Volans, Auriga, Aquila, Aries and Mira brakes.", "product_code": "6015-697", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Cyclocross", "Cycle touring", "Cycle commuting", "Trail riding"], "Type": ["Disc"], "Made in": ["Malaysia"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9185923891230/6015697-NOC02.jpg"]}
