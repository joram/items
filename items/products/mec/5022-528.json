They're the first wire gates to use a spring mechanism similar to the ones found on standard gates. This type of mechanism lasts twice as long as the usual wire-gate setup, and has smooth gate action that feels similar to the popular Petzl\u00ae Spirit.Strength of 22kN with closed gate, 10kN with open gate, 7kN if cross-loaded.Gate opening of 2.6cm.Monofil (single wire) gate offers a hybrid of wire gate and standard gate design.Notchless nose won't catch on stuff.H-shaped profile is thicker on the inside, for durability and smooth rope handling.CE certified.", "product_code": "5022-528", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["34g"], "Ideal for": ["Snow and ice climbing", "Rock climbing"], "Gate type": ["Wire"], "Material": ["Aluminum alloy"], "Strength closed": ["22kN"], "Strength cross-loaded": ["7kN"], "Strength open": ["10kN"], "Gate opening": ["2.6cm"], "Snag-free nose": ["Yes"], "CE certified": ["Yes"], "Made in": ["France"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807147110430/5022528-BL000.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807147110430/5022528-BL000.jpg"]}
