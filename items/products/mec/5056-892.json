A bit of spandex added to the burly nylon fabric provides some give for long moves and high steps. A gusseted crotch gives you freedom of movement while double-layered fabric in the seat won't wear through in one season.Made of light and durable nylon and spandex.Streamlined cut slides easily under a harness, but is roomy enough for full mobility.Waistband is flat in the back with extra-high coverage and elasticated in the front with a drawstring for a secure fit.Front hand pockets have mesh pocket bags to add ventilation.Dedicated side brush pocket for easy access on scruffy routes.\n\nRegular fit\n\n\n\nFit guide\n\nGarments, designed for specific activities have features that aren\u2019t always adaptable to general use.
