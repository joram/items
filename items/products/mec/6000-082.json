Leave the regular mesh tent body and footprint at home, and swap in the Fast & Light Tent body instead. It's a beefed-up footprint that features a bathtub-style floor to guard against wind and rain splatter for more protection than a simple footprint-and-rainfly setup.Setup is easy: simply stake out the Fast & Light Body, insert the poles, clip the body to the poles, then attach the fly overtop.Made of lightweight 15-denier nylon ripstop with a 1200mm Xtreme Shield coating that does away with conventional seam taping and won't degrade like traditional PU coatings.Poles and fly not included. This Fast & Light Body is designed to be used with your current MSR Freelite 3-Person Tent setup.", "product_code": "6000-082", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["340g"], "Ideal for": ["Backpacking"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9023566381086/6000082-RED00.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9010294489118/6000082-RED00-ALT-INSIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9023566381086/6000082-RED00.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9010294489118/6000082-RED00-ALT-INSIDE.jpg"]}
