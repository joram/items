The Vis 180 Pro has a large 180-degree reflector panel that creates a wide swath of eye-catching light with amber side lights placed where motorists can see them. You can angle the light as needed to keep it visible and not impeded by your fenders, pack or seatbag.Includes a high (150 lumens) and low pulse (75 lumens) setting, a steady (100 lumens) mode, or a paceline (5 lumens) that eliminates the top pulsing light.High pulse mode puts out a dazzling 150 lumens.Accurate battery charge indicator has 4 status levels.Low battery warning and auto-shutoff to prevent damage.Light and strong aluminum body.Locking pivot point mounts either on a seat post or seat stay and can still be angled for max visibility.When angled, the light is locked in the mount, but you can fold it flat and slide it out to prevent theft without undoing the mount.Integrated clip also attaches to packs and bags.Charges via micro USB port (includes a cable) for use with your laptop or phone charger.
