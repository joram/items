The design functions correctly regardless of which way the rope is loaded. The inner wheel works using inertia. It spins at 2m/s, and to brake, a small clutch engages, stops the wheel, and stops the rope from moving through the device. It offers smooth belaying without the risk of the device locking up. Unlocks with a gentle tug of the brake end rope.Panic-proof locking mechanism can't be over-ridden when belaying or lowering.Bi-directional locking function works however the rope is loaded.Frictionless design for smooth handling even on larger-diameter ropes.Useable with any style of locking carabiner.CE and EN certified.", "product_code": "5052-892", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["245g"], "Ideal for": ["Sport and toprope climbing", "Indoor climbing"], "Type": ["Mechanically assisted"], "Material": ["Aluminum alloy"], "Rope diameter\n\nThe maximum diameter or the range of rope diameter that is compatible with the device.": ["8.5-11mm"], "Belay off anchor\n\nUse an autoblock device with a locking carabiner to belay off the anchor or to bring up two seconds on independent lines.": ["No"], "CE certified": ["Yes"], "Made in": ["Italy"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8875039916062/5052892-GUN00.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932457545758/5052892-GUN00-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932459151390/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LOCKED.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932458004510/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE4.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932458168350/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE3.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932458201118/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932459610142/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE1.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8875039916062/5052892-GUN00.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932457545758/5052892-GUN00-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932459151390/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LOCKED.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932458004510/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE4.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932458168350/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE3.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932458201118/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8932459610142/5052892-GUN00-ALT-LIFESTYLE1.jpg"]}
