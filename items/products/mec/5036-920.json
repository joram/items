Now re-designed, the wash bag has a molded grip to aid scrubbing, a flexible internal washboard, and instructions for use printed on the front. Fold it up and pack it along to revive your travel, trekking, or hiking clothes.To wash: Add water, soap, and clothes (20-40% volume). Roll down the top 4-5 times and clip the ends. Open and squeeze the purge valve to expel air. Scrub your clothes against the internal washboard (30 seconds, 3 minutes, whatever you need.)To rinse: Unroll the bag, drain the water and rinse clothes with fresh water in the bag, or under a running tap or shower.Rinse, invert and dry the bag after each use (otherwise the internal waterproof layer will be compromised).To prevent damage to the coatings, avoid exposure to heat (50\u00b0C) or direct sunlight.Wrap clothes to cover zips, buckles or other hard features that could damage the internal coating.", "product_code": "5036-920", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["142g"], "Ideal for": ["Travel", "Camping and hiking"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938700832798/5036920-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8809955557406/5036920-NOC02-ALT-INHAND.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8809955917854/5036920-NOC02-ALT-DETAIL2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8809956212766/5036920-NOC02-ALT-DETAIL.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938737369118/5036920-NOC02-ALT-VALVE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938737401886/5036920-NOC02-ALT-PACKED.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938737500190/5036920-NOC02-ALT-NODULES2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738122782/5036920-NOC02-ALT-NODULES.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738155550/5036920-NOC02-ALT-LIFESTYLE3.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738319390/5036920-NOC02-ALT-LIFESTYLE2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738548766/5036920-NOC02-ALT-LIFESTYLE1.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938700832798/5036920-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8809955557406/5036920-NOC02-ALT-INHAND.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8809955917854/5036920-NOC02-ALT-DETAIL2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8809956212766/5036920-NOC02-ALT-DETAIL.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938737369118/5036920-NOC02-ALT-VALVE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938737401886/5036920-NOC02-ALT-PACKED.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938737500190/5036920-NOC02-ALT-NODULES2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738122782/5036920-NOC02-ALT-NODULES.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738155550/5036920-NOC02-ALT-LIFESTYLE3.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738319390/5036920-NOC02-ALT-LIFESTYLE2.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8938738548766/5036920-NOC02-ALT-LIFESTYLE1.jpg"]}
