Then here\u2019s the hiking guidebook for you. Subtitled The Premier Trails in Southeast BC, near Kaslo and Nelson, it doesn\u2019t waste your time on any of the inferior options. No wonder: these are the same authors who gave us Don\u2019t Waste Your Time in the Canadian Rockies, the Opinionated Hiking Guide.  This West Kootenay book covers a lesser known, little-visited mountain wilderness.Located in southeast British Columbia, the West Kootenays are made up of the West Purcell, Selkirk and Monashee ranges, and include Valhalla, Kokanee Glacier and Goat Range provincial parks. It\u2019s an immense region, but the authors focus your attention on the 55 most rewarding day hikes and backpacking trips. Follow their advice to hike trails that go through the region's signature scenery: lakes, meadows, ridges, glaciers and peaks. 140 colour photos help you choose your adventure, and an orientation map for each trail helps you visualize your journey. The authors begin each trip with an opinion section that tells you what to expect on that trail and how to have the optimal experience. Each trip also has facts that tell you precisely how to drive to the trailhead, and then describe in clear, concise detail how to stay on the path to your destination.", "product_code": "5031-229", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Day hiking", "Backpacking"], "Regionality": ["British Columbia"], "Author": ["Kathy Copeland, Craig Copeland"], "Language": ["English"], "Pages": ["304"], "Published": ["2013"], "Edition": ["3rd"], "ISBN": ["9781927462003"], "Made in": ["Canada"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815631433758/5031229-NOC02.jpg"]}
