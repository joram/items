{"name": "MEC Scully 150 Dry Duffle", "categories": ["Home", "All", "Watersports", "Kayaking", "Dry bags", "Scully 150 Dry Duffle"], "description": "Unstrapped from a roof rack, tossed in a cargo hold, and splashed onto the floor of a canoe \u2013 just another day for this rugged expedition dry bag. The rectangular shape is stable, stackable and makes it easy to find small items.  The upper flap unzips to reveal a wide roll-top closure that can be sealed to keep water out, or strapped out of the way for use as a conventional duffle. Multiple lash points let you secure the Scully to any surface. Members asked for a bigger size, and 150L should give you room to carry just about anything.Coated nylon fabric is super rugged and PVC-free.Top flap zipper has oversized pull loops to accommodate gloved hands or chilled fingers.Inside top flap has a zippered mesh pocket for quick-access items.Snaps hold the wide roll-top closure strips in place to ensure easy rolling and an effective seal.Purge valve allows air evacuation to make the bag as small as possible.Carrying options include top, side and end handles or comfortable, stow-away shoulder straps.All materials are PVC-free except for the purge valve, which is hard PVC. Hard PVC contains fewer eco-hazardous plasticizers than soft PVC, and is fully recyclable.Note: these dry bags do not provide submersible waterproof protection or impact protection. For electronics, we recommend hard cases with gasket seals.", "product_code": "5063-647", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["2.4kg"], "Ideal for": ["Watersports", "Travel"], "Closure": ["Roll-top and lid"], "Material": ["PU-coated nylon"], "Ruggedness\n\nFair: made of lightweight materials and designed to be carried inside another bag.
