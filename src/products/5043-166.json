Dry Cover treatment on the sheath resists dust and humidity and makes it a smooth running rope.Diameter is  best used for lead climbing, not for top roping or extensive hang-dogging.Unicore construction bonds the sheath and core so there should never be any sheath slippage.Dry Cover treatment on the sheath resists dust, humidity and abrasion and improves handling.Beal plants a tree for every rope sold.", "product_code": "5043-166", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["4.13kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.

Higher numbers indicate stretchier ropes.": ["9.5%"], "Impact force\n\nThe amount of force, in kN, that the first UIAA fall puts on the falling object.
