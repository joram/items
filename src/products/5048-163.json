In this popular guide, Alan Kane brings together over 150 of his favourite scrambles, starting in Waterton National Park and working his way up through the Crowsnest area and Kananaskis Country into the contiguous national parks of Banff, Kootenay, Yoho and Jasper. Each peak can be climbed in one day from a road or backcountry lodge. Scrambles are graded and range from easy walk-ups for experienced hikers who want a little more challenge to more difficult, hands-on scrambles for climbers. Each mountain is well illustrated with route photos and often a photo of the crux.", "product_code": "5048-163", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Alpine climbing and mountaineering"], "Regionality": ["Rockies"], "Author": ["Alan Kane"], "Language": ["English"], "Pages": ["448"], "Published": ["2016"], "Edition": ["3rd"], "ISBN": ["9781771600972"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815681601566/5048163-NOC02.jpg"]}
