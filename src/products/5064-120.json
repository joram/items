A favourite of lightweight backpackers for over a decade, the Mutha Hubba NX now has composite poles that flex under heavy winds, then bounce back to their original shape. Xtreme Shield waterproof coating on the fly and floor is lighter than conventional seam taping and won't degrade like traditional PU coatings.For 2020, MSR updated the fly with a waterproof sealant along the seams, adding a layer of protection between you and the elements.StayDry side-entry vestibules have rain gutters to channel water away.Fly colour offers neutral interior lighting. Red floor makes gear easy to spot.Colour-coded staking loops.Rope-bag-style sack fits into oddly shaped corners of your pack.Includes lightweight pegs and reflective guylines.For a lighter shelter, you can setup the fly with a footprint (sold separately).Compatible with the MSR Universal 3 Regular footprint (sold separately).", "product_code": "5064-120", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["2.18kg"], "Ideal for": ["Backpacking"], "Capacity\n\nThe number of average sized people that the product can comfortably sleep.": ["3-person"], "Seasons": ["3-season"], "Door(s)": ["2 doors"], "Vestibule(s)": ["2 vestibules"], "Canopy fabric": ["20-denier nylon ripstop"], "Canopy mesh": ["15-denier nylon mesh"], "Floor fabric": ["30-denier nylon ripstop"], "Floor coating": ["Polyurethane"], "Floor waterproofness\n\nThe standard test for coated fabrics uses a standing pipe (column) filled with water.
