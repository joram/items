The digital dial is an intuitive welcome twist on the classic multi-button layout. COROS packs a lot into 36g, onboard GPS provides speed and distance info, an optical heart rate sensor provides pulse related metrics, and internal accelerometers translate your movements into information. Dozens of sport profiles include a robust strength training mode to target muscle groups. After the workout, view a detailed summary of reps and sets and heart rate data. With the free COROS app, see a heatmap of the muscle groups worked. The app also lets you share and download workouts, review activities, receive texts, social media alerts and email.Sport profiles include: running (indoor and outdoor), cycling (indoor and outdoor), swimming (pool and open water), triathlon, gym cardio, strength training and more.Multisport lets you transition and track different activities within a single workout.Strength training program has more than 200 exercises, selectable muscle groups, auto-detects reps, counts sets and provides a comprehensive breakdown in the app with body-mapped exercise tracking, including how many reps you did for each muscle group.Integrated running power meter.Track running mode selects activity, lane and even snaps your distances to match your activities e.g., 500m or 800m.Optical heart rate monitor measures heart rate right off your wrist and even works while swimming.Recovery advisor prevents over-training and helps maximize training intervals.Advanced training metrics: VO2max, training effect, training load, threshold pace and more.Digital dial scrolls through modes, settings and metrics with a single finger.Intelligent battery profiles provide 20 hours of continuous training use, up to 100 hours in UltraMax GPS mode and 20 days in smart watch mode.GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and QZSS satellite constellation support for strong signal anywhere.Free COROS app has downloadable workouts, workout breakdowns, activity tracking information, third party training app integration e.g., Strava\u2122, Training Peaks\u2122, etc., and much more (via your phone\u2019s Bluetooth\u2122 connection).Bluetooth Smart and ANT+ lets you connect to a variety of different sensors, including: power meters (cycling and running), cadence and speed sensors, foot pods, heart rate belts and more.STRYD\u2122 foot pod support (sold separately).Daily activity tracking with calories burnt, steps, floors climbed and sleep tracking.Night mode backlights low-light sessions, turns off when activity is complete or 1 hour after sunrise.ABC data via internal altimeter, barometer and compass.Bright colour screen is easy to see in all conditions.50m water resistance.Uses standard 20mm straps, making customizing easy.In the box: Pace 2, charging cable and documentation.", "product_code": "6015-520", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["36g"], "Ideal for": ["Fitness and training", "Road running", "Road cycling"], "Face material\n\nPolycarbonate is inexpensive and light, with good clarity and wear-resistance.
