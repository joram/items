It packs down to the same size as your water bottle, but weighs less than half as much and keeps you warm when the temp dips towards freezing. The secret sauce is the premium 900-fill-power down insulation that has great compressibility and provides exceptional warmth at a light weight, combined with mesh box baffled construction that maximizes loft and minimizes cold spots.Gossamer-thin 10-denier ripstop nylon shell and lining save weight and bulk. DWR-treated shell repels moisture and condensation.Down has a Nikwax hydrophobic treatment to dry faster, maintain loft better and retain less moisture than traditional down.Down is certified to the Responsible Down Standard for animal welfare.Reflective ThermaCapture\u2122 lining seals in heat to provide additional warmth without adding grams.Removable SynergyLink\u2122 connector holds your mattress in place under the quilt for better thermal efficiency and comfort.Perimeter side draft tubes, a snap neck closure and an enclosed foot box keep cold air from sneaking in.Includes both a stuff sack and a storage sack.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Responsible Down", "product_code": "5064-171", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["430g (Regular)", "480g (Long)"], "Ideal for": ["Backpacking"], "Length": ["Regular fits to 6' 0\" (183 cm)", "Long fits to 6' 6\" (198 cm)"], "Capacity\n\nThe number of average sized people that the product can comfortably sleep.": ["1-person"], "Temperature": ["0\u00b0C"], "Shape": ["Mummy"], "EN Comfort Temperature Rating\n\nThis sleeping bag has been tested to the EN standard in a certified lab.
