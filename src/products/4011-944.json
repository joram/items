(Using wooden or plastic utensils will increase the life of the non-stick coating.) The bottom is grooved to resist slipping on those less-than-perfectly-level stove sites. The handle folds for transport, and locks into the open position so you can dazzle your trail companions with your pancake-flipping prowess.", "product_code": "4011-944", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["382g"], "Ideal for": ["Backpacking", "Car camping"], "Material": ["Anodized aluminum"], "Includes": ["1 frying pan"], "Diameter": ["20 cm"], "Dimensions": ["21.8\u00a0x\u00a06.5cm"], "Non-stick": ["Yes"], "Foldable handle": ["No"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8812500975646/4011944-NOC02.jpg"]}
