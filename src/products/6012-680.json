Developed with Team Qhubeka Assos, the Rivale makes MET part of the aero helmet revolution. The streamlined design saves up to 3 watts at 50km/hr \u2013 a massive gain for a single piece of equipment.MIPS-C2\u00ae technology (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) reduces rotational forces in an oblique impact. An inner shell sandwiched under the foam reduces the rotational torque on your skull.Low-profile silhouette has 18 generously sized vents.Homothetic Embedded Skeleton dissipates impacts across the entire shell.Safe T Advanced retention system provides a locked-in, nuanced fit.Adjustment wheel.Cool max interior pads rapidly absorb and dissipate perspiration.", "product_code": "6012-680", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["250g (Medium)"], "Ideal for": ["Road cycling", "Cyclocross"], "Construction\n\nMicroshell helmets are made of a thin polymer sheet over a foam liner; Hardshell helmets have a hard polymer outer shell and a foam liner; when the liner is being bonded to the outer shell during the manufacturing process, it is Molded in the shell.": ["Molded in the shell"], "Shell material": ["Polycarbonate"], "Fit system": ["Adjustable dial"], "Inner material": ["EPS (expanded polystyrene)"], "Circumference\n\nThe internal circumference determines the size head that the helmet will fit.": ["52-56cm (black red/matt glossy Small)", "56-58cm (black red/matt glossy Medium)", "58-61cm (black red/matt glossy Large)"], "Vents": ["Yes"], "Approved for\n\nMost helmets are tested and certified for a specific sport.
