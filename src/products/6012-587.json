The Guardian purifies and filters water, so you don't need to carry chemical water treatment or a UV purifier when you're in virus territory. The gravity system is a low-effort option that needs no pumping - simply fill and raise the reservoir and let gravity filter and purify your water while you set up camp, prep dinner, or just relax.Durable film reservoir with 1000-denier fabric bottom for increased abrasion resistance.Hollow fibre technology uses polymer fibres to create a high-surface-area filter that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.02 micron effective pore size.Activated carbon reduces concentrations of some chemicals (including iodine and chlorine), odours and tastes.Purge valve flushes system without the need to backflush.Universal bottle attapter attaches to most water bottles.Meets NSF protocol P248 military standards.", "product_code": "6012-587", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["532g"], "Ideal for": ["Camping and hiking", "Backpacking", "Travel"], "Filter type\n\nWater can be treated using various types of filters, chemicals or non-chemical purification methods, or a combination.
