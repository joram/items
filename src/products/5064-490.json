Enjoy 3-season camping and touring with your partner. With plenty of room for two sleepers, exceptional insulation and integrated sleeping pad sleeves, the Cabin Creek is as close to at-home comfort as you get outdoors. Part of Big Agnes\u2019 System line, so you never have to worry about rolling off your pad in the middle of the night. An integrated sleeve holds your pad, or pads, snug against you and your partner\u2019s back, keeping you warm and comfy. Pad integration reduces weight and bulk, by doing away with insulation on the bottom side of the bag. Besides reduced weight and bulk, the integrated pad has the bonus eliminating \"cover hogging\" in the middle of the night.Shell is lightweight nylon with a water-repellent finish. Lining is soft polyester microfiber.FireLine\u2122 Eco insulation is composed of 100% post-consumer recycled polyester. Low denier fibres are tightly woven to provide high-loft, compressibility, a high weight-to-warmth ratio and durability.Flow\u2122 construction uses horizontal baffles to create tunnels of warmth that wrap around your body. The baffles also prevent the insulation from shifting and creating cold spots.Draft flap behind the zipper, yoke and draft wedge at the connection between the pad and the bag ensure cold air doesn't sneak in.Integrated sleeping pad sleeve has side stretch panels to accommodate different pad thicknesses. Fits two 51 x 183cm sleeping pads or one 127 x 183 double sized pad (sold separately).Since there's no insulation on the bottom, for best results, use with pads that have an R-value of 4 or more.Free Range footbox allows plenty of room for happy feet.Hood lets you lift and move your head, even when fully zipped up and has a one-handed cinch adjustment.Built-in pockets keep pillows in place through the night.Interior loops for attaching a bag liner.Hang loops let you air it out in the sun.Includes a mesh storage bag and a nylon stuff sack.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n.st0{stroke:#333;stroke-width:.79;stroke-miterlimit:10}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content", "product_code": "5064-490", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["2.1kg"], "Ideal for": ["Car camping"], "Length": ["Regular fits to 6' 0\" (183 cm)"], "Capacity\n\nThe number of average sized people that the product can comfortably sleep.": ["2-person"], "Temperature": ["-9\u00b0C"], "Shape": ["Barrel"], "Insulation": ["Synthetic"], "Technology": ["FireLine"], "Construction": ["Baffle"], "Face fabric": ["Nylon ripstop"], "Lining/backer": ["Polyester"], "Packed size": ["20 x 24cm"], "Shoulder girth": ["267cm"], "Hip girth": ["267cm"], "Foot girth": ["213cm"], "Yoke\n\nAn insulated collar that covers yours neck and shoulders to reduce heat loss.": ["Yes"], "Additional feature(s)": ["Draft tube behind zipper", "DWR-treated shell fabric", "Pillow pocket", "Sleeping pad sleeve or straps", "Stuff sack included", "Home storage sack included"], "Product sustainability": ["Recycled content"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9023097962526/5064490-NAV99.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227115038/5064490-NAV99-ALT-HALFOPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227246110/5064490-NAV99-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227409950/5064490-NAV99-ALT-BACKSINGLES.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227999774/5064490-NAV99-ALT-BACKDOUBLE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024228851742/5064490-NAV99-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9023097962526/5064490-NAV99.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227115038/5064490-NAV99-ALT-HALFOPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227246110/5064490-NAV99-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227409950/5064490-NAV99-ALT-BACKSINGLES.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024227999774/5064490-NAV99-ALT-BACKDOUBLE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9024228851742/5064490-NAV99-ALT-SIDE.jpg"]}
