The granite may be bigger and more established in Squamish, but the weather is drier in the Kootenays and the climbing scene is budding. This guide covers over 400 climbs from classic alpine routes to lakeside sport crags.", "product_code": "5020-654", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Alpine climbing and mountaineering"], "Regionality": ["British Columbia"], "Author": ["Aaron Kristianson, Vince Hempsall"], "Language": ["English"], "Pages": ["162"], "Published": ["2009"], "ISBN": ["9780981262208"], "Made in": ["Canada"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815602991134/5020654-NOC02.jpg"]}
