Can it be amazing on the climb, but responsive and stiff on the descent? The Hoji Pro Tour is all that \u2013 and then some. Switch from tour to ski mode by flipping a single lever. For real: no messing around with power straps, tightening buckles and fixing your pant cuffs. Instead of relying on a pin to lock the cuff, the innovative Hoji Lock System uses a sliding tongue-in-groove spine to lock things up. This design allows the cuff to be supported by the shell directly, resulting in a stiff and much more progressive flex. When you switch to walk mode, the sliding spine is pulled up and out of the way to allow a 55\u00b0 range of motion. The same ski/walk lever also controls the upper buckle.Grilamid shell, cuff, and spoiler make for a stiff and light boot.Liners are heat-mouldable for a comfortable and precise fit.Hoji Lock uses sliding tongue-in-groove to create a firm connection in ski mode.Hoji Lock allows you to go from walk to ski with a single lever \u2013 for real.Ultra-Lock system locks the cuff for stiffness when skiing and less friction when walking.Micro-adjustable buckles ensure a perfect fit.V-shaped tongue allows for comfortable movement when skinning while providing support on the descent.Cramp-in system allows for use of ultralight crampons to help with peakbagging.Cuff and buckle catches prevent unwanted release.Master Step tech inserts allows for incredibly easy step-in to your bindings.11 degrees of forward lean in ski mode provides a solid stance.Range of motion in walk mode is 55 degrees.Progressive forward flex of 120 is ideal for charging steep and challenging lines.Compatible with tech bindings only.", "product_code": "5059-403", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["2.9kg (27)"], "Ideal for": ["Alpine touring"], "Boot/binding compatibility\n\nThe boot and binding systems must match for best performance and safe use.": ["Tech"], "Buckles": ["3"], "Lower shell material": ["Grilamid"], "Shell cuff material": ["Grilamid"], "Sole type\n\nAlpine Touring: with tread; compatible with DIN touring bindings.
