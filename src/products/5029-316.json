It also adds insulation, and dampens vibration that can sap your strength. Great for replacing chewed up rubber or worn out tape.To apply, wrap the tape around the shaft stretching it as you go. The tape will adhere as it contracts, although it's not sticky like conventional tape.Dimensions are 19mm width x 1m length. Enough for a single tool.Same tape as the stuff used on Petzl\u00ae Nomic tools.", "product_code": "5029-316", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["44g"], "Ideal for": ["Snow and ice climbing"], "Made in": ["France"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807450214430/5029316-NOC02.jpg"]}
