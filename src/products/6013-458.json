This beacon fits in a pocket and transmits on 2 frequencies simultaneously once activated. The 406 MHz signal goes to both the GEOSAR and LEOSAR satellite constellations. The 121.5 MHz transmission is a local signal that searchers can triangulate on once in your vicinity. A manually-activated SOS strobe guides SAR personnel at night.Broadcasts SOS to government funded satellite networks, so there's no monthly fee.Transmits a unique beacon identifier you register with the Rescue Coordination Centre for fast response time as SAR teams know what to look for.66-channel GPS receiver pinpoints locations within a few metres and embeds it in the signal to GEOSAR satellites.Battery lasts 7 years in storage, transmits for more than 24 hours at -20\u00b0C.Battery replacement can be done at an Ocean Signal authorised battery replacement centres.Retractable antenna improves signal strength in challenging conditions.1-button activation with a spring loaded hard-plastic cover, prevents accidental activation.Cancel button for accidental activation.Test button for yearly readines checks.Bright white strobe (13 lumens) signals  SOS transmission, and guides rescuers to your position.LED indicator provides transmission details.Floatation pouch included to make it bouyant.Waterproof to 15m.", "product_code": "6013-458", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["116g"], "Ideal for": ["Emergency preparedness"], "Transmission duration": ["24 hours @ -20\u00baC"], "Satellite network used": ["COSPAS-SARSAT"], "Operating temperature": ["-20 to 55\u00b0C"], "Battery life (operating)": ["24\u00a0h"], "Frequency (alert)": ["406MHz"], "Storage temperature": ["-30 to 70\u00b0C"], "Dimensions": ["3.3\u00a0x\u00a05.1\u00a0x\u00a07.7cm"], "Frequency (homing)": ["121.5MHz"], "Battery life (standby)": ["61320\u00a0h"], "IPX rating\n\nIndicates the degree of protection against liquid.
