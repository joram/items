Designed from the ground up for side sleepers, the Sidewinder uses an innovative cocoon pattern to get you a great night\u2019s sleep. The SL version uses a body-mapped blend of down and synthetic insulation keeping coziness where it counts. And, the blanket like hood has hand pockets in the corners, so you can tuck yourself in just like you would at home.Shell is lightweight nylon, lining is soft polyester microfiber, and both have a water-repellent finish.850 fill DownTek\u2122 uses a Bluesign\u2122 approved chemistry to treat for water-repellency, has antimicrobial and antibacterial protection, and is sourced under the Responsible Down Standard.FireLine Eco insulation is composed of 100% post-consumer recycled polyester. Low denier fibres are tightly woven to provide high-loft, compressibility, a high weight-to-warmth ratio and durability.Synthetic insulation is used at the hips and in the foot box, this reduces common cold spots for side sleepers.Cocoon design keeps side sleepers cozy by keeping insulation close to the body.Horizontal baffles create tunnels of warmth that wrap around your body, and prevent insulation from shifting and creating cold spots.Draft flap behind the ambidextrous, anti-snag locking zipper ensures cold air doesn't sneak in.Optimized footbox mimics the natural position of your feet when lying on your side.Hood lets you lift and move your head, even when fully zipped up and has a one-handed cinch adjustment.Stretch-mesh pillow pocket keeps your pillow right where you want it.Hang loops let you air it out in the sun.Includes a mesh storage bag and a nylon stuff sack.Women's version is wider at hip, narrower at shoulders, with extra insulation at chest and feet.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Responsible Down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n.st0{stroke:#333;stroke-width:.79;stroke-miterlimit:10}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content", "product_code": "6012-245", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["1.19kg (Regular Right Zip)", "1.11kg (Petite Right Zip)"], "Ideal for": ["Backpacking"], "Length": ["Fits up to 5' 10\" (177 cm) (Regular Right Zip)", "Fits up to 5' 5\" (165 cm) (Petite Right Zip)"], "Capacity\n\nThe number of average sized people that the product can comfortably sleep.": ["1-person"], "Temperature": ["-7\u00b0C"], "Shape": ["Mummy"], "Insulation": ["650 fill-power water-repellent goose down", "Synthetic"], "Down weight\n\nThe amount of down used to fill the product (measured in grams and given for size medium bags).": ["700g (Regular Right Zip)", "634g (Petite Right Zip)"], "Technology": ["DownTek", "FireLine"], "Construction": ["Offset quilt"], "Face fabric": ["Nylon ripstop"], "Lining/backer": ["Polyester"], "Packed size": ["19 x 20cm (Regular Right Zip)", "18 x 20cm (Petite Right Zip)"], "Shoulder girth": ["147cm (Regular Right Zip)", "142cm (Petite Right Zip)"], "Hip girth": ["142cm (Regular Right Zip)", "137cm (Petite Right Zip)"], "Foot girth": ["84cm (Regular Right Zip)", "79cm (Petite Right Zip)"], "Yoke\n\nAn insulated collar that covers yours neck and shoulders to reduce heat loss.": ["No"], "Additional feature(s)": ["Draft tube behind zipper", "Interior pocket(s)", "Stuff sack included", "Pillow pocket", "DWR-treated shell fabric"], "Product sustainability": ["Certified Responsible Down", "Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material", "Recycled content"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160513585182/6012245-LBT12.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160765112350/6012245-LBT12-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160765177886/6012245-LBT12-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160513585182/6012245-LBT12.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160765112350/6012245-LBT12-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9160765177886/6012245-LBT12-ALT-SIDE.jpg"]}
