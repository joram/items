The dry treatment meets the UIAA water repellent standards and it's PFC-free. A great option if you're looking for a skinny redpointing rope or for a single rope to use for alpine routes.Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating.EcoDry finish makes this rope durably water-repellent and dirt-resistant without the use of PFCs.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling.Meets testing standards to certify it as a single, half or twin.Specs shown are for use as a single rope.When used as a half rope, the specs are as follows:\nDynamic elongation: 30%\nStatic elongation: 8.6%\nImpact force: 6.7kN\nUIAA fall rating: 22When used as a twin rope, the specs are as follows (based on tests with 2 strands):\nDynamic elongation: 28%\nStatic elongation: 5.3%\nImpact force: 10.4kN\nUIAA fall rating: 22\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product", "product_code": "5058-023", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.12kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing", "Alpine climbing and mountaineering"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)", "Half", "Twin"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
