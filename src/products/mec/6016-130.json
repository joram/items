The sport-cap style valve has a high-flow rate, with additional threads that screw to most wide-mouth tops when you want to fill larger containers.BPA- and BPS-free bottle with 400ml capacity.Hollow fibre technology uses polymer fibres to create a high-surface-area filter that allows water to flow quickly through a 0.015 micron effective pore size.Replaceable activated carbon disc reduces concentrations of some chemicals (including iodine and chlorine), odours and tastes.Includes 5ft. hose for easy access to water sources.Bottle is 24.5 x 8cm.Exceeds NSF protocol P231 and WHO2011 drinking water standards.", "product_code": "6016-130", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["425g"], "Ideal for": ["Camping and hiking", "Emergency preparedness", "Everyday use"], "Filter type\n\nWater can be treated using various types of filters, chemicals or non-chemical purification methods, or a combination.
