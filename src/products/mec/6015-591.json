Training is just one part of performance, the Vantage V2 examines how you fuel your training, how you train and how you recover. Taking in all this data via an array of sensors, internal GPS provides speed and distance info, an optical heart rate sensor provides all sorts of pulse related metrics, and internal accelerometers translate your movements into information you can use to train smarter. There\u2019s even an internal running power meter, no foot pod needed. Onboard fitness testing lets you track your progress, walking you through a variety of fitness tests. Test results can be seen on your wrist or through Polar Flow\u2019s testing dashboard.
