The side-mounted lever is easier to use than bike-pump-type filters. The base of the filter is threaded to screw directly onto Nalgene\u00ae wide-mouth water bottles or all MSR Dromedary\u2122 bags, reducing spillage and the risk of cross-contamination with unfiltered water. The over-pressure relief valve vents water back down the intake hose, so you don\u2019t get soaked with untreated water. A gauge is supplied so you can determine when it\u2019s time to replace the ceramic filter element.Filters at 1L per minute flow rate using AirSpring\u2122 air bubble technology.Effective against protozoa, and 0.2 micron or larger bacteria.Reduces concentrations of some chemicals (including iodine and chlorine).Reduces odours and tastes.Foam pre-filter included.", "product_code": "5001-239", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["456g"], "Ideal for": ["Camping and hiking"], "Filter type\n\nWater can be treated using various types of filters, chemicals or non-chemical purification methods, or a combination.
