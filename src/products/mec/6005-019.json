Equipped with the latest generation Elevate optical heart rate monitor, it reads your pulse straight off your wrist, no need for a chest strap. Running metrics like speed and distance are handled by the onboard GPS and internal accelerometers. These sensors all work together, turning your movement into data, making sure you get credit for all you do, in the gym, the pool and on the trails. Having your phone on hand and connected via the free Garmin Connect app, opens a world of smartwatch functionality. Garmin Connect lets you review activities, download training plans, keep an eye on the weather and receive texts, social media alerts and email.Built-in activity modes for biking, running, walking, swimming (indoor only), gym focused activities (strength training \u2013 with rep counter, cardio and elliptical training, stair stepping, indoor rowing and yoga) and more (no multisport mode).A powerful, internal antenna connects to 3 different satellite constellations, GPS, GLONASS and Galileo. Multiple networks, combined with satellite position caching, give you a fast connection and a strong GPS signal wherever you are.Internet Live Tracking during activities (through a connected smartphone) allows you to share your location and heart rate with friends, family, or coaches.UltraTrac\u2122 mode allows you to stay in the field longer, reducing the GPS recording rate in order to conserve battery.Equipped with Garmin\u2019s new V3 low-profile Elevate\u2122 optical heart rate monitor which provides more reliable constant heart rate data and allows you to train without a chest strap. Elevate V3 includes a red LED to provide Pulse Ox measurements.Physiological metrics includes VO2 max \u2013 which now takes ambient temperature into consideration, an improved race predictor, recovery advisor and performance indicator.Training status uses data from past workouts to learn your fitness level and tell you how effective your training is.Broadcast of your HR over ANT+ (so other devices can pick it up).Compatible with running dynamics sensors (sold separately) for cadence, ground contact time, stride length, vertical oscillation, vertical ratio and ground contact time.Incident detection uses the internal sensors to detect if an accident has occurred.  In the case of an accident the unit will send a signal through your paired smartphone to your emergency contacts, letting them know where you are and that you need help.Stress level score monitors heart rate variability while inactive to produce a stress score from 0-100, the lower the score, the lower your stress.  When stress levels are high, the 245\u2019s relaxation timer will take you through steps to lower your stress levels.24/7 activity tracking, 245 learns your activity level and helps guide you towards a more active lifestyle.Move bar reminds you to move after being stationary for too long.On board sleep tracking mode monitors your rest, letting you see your total sleep hours as well as periods of movement and restful sleep in your Connect profile.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) come in via Bluetooth connection to your smartphone.Automatically sync your data to a paired smartphone running the free Garmin Connect app.Compatible with all smartphones featuring Bluetooth 4.0 (iPhone 4s or higher, and Android 4.3 or higher).Connects with ANT+ and Bluetooth Smart, from foot pods, to speed and cadence pods, to Varia lights, but not power meters.Connect IQ support allows you to download apps, templates, data fields, watch faces, and other features.Always-on, colour display is bright and clear in any conditions.Internal memory stores up to 200 hours of activities. Garmin Connect will store all of your activity data.User-friendly strap changes, thanks to quick-release pins.Rechargeable lithium-ion battery lasts up to 24 hours in GPS mode or up to 7 days in smartwatch mode.In the box: Forerunner 245, charging cable and documentation.", "product_code": "6005-019", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["39g"], "Ideal for": ["Running, fitness and training", "Cycling", "Swim training"], "Face material\n\nPolycarbonate is inexpensive and light, with good clarity and wear-resistance.
