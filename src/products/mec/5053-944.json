{"name": "Where Locals Hike In The Canadian Rockies 5th Edition", "categories": ["Home", "All", "Travel gear", "Books and maps", "Guidebooks", "Where Locals Hike In The Canadian Rockies 5th"], "description": "A guide to the Premier Trails in Kananaskis Country, near Canmore and Calgary, so you won\u2019t waste time on inferior options. Though less well-known than Banff and Jasper National Parks, the area includes Peter Lougheed and Spray Valley Provincial Parks, which feel  just as immense, with peaks, ridges, meadows and lakes that are equally dazzling. The only difference is that K-Country doesn\u2019t attract national-park-sized crowds. This guide focuses on 58 rewarding dayhikes and backpack trips. It includes 150 colour photos and an orientation map for each trail. The authors begin each trip with an Opinion section, so you\u2019ll know what to expect and how to have the best experience. A Facts section tells you how to drive to the trailhead, and describes in clear, concise detail how to stay on the path to your destination. The 5th edition, published in 2017, is revised since the 2013 floods. The authors re-hiked the region, added 5 new trails, updated descriptions of a dozen others, and refined their commentary throughout.", "product_code": "5053-944", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Camping and hiking"], "Regionality": ["Rockies"], "Author": ["Kathy Copeland, Craig Copeland"], "Language": ["English"], "Pages": ["296"], "Published": ["2017"], "Edition": ["5th"], "ISBN": ["9781927462041"], "Made in": ["Canada"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8886210592798/5053944-NOC02.jpg"]}
