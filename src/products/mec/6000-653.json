A firm in-hand feel makes clipping easy, and the smooth, tight sheath keeps drag low through gear and over rock. Comes with a hollow-braid Technora\u00ae cord to help you build a prusik or klemheist hitch for safety on rappels.All-round rope features suit cragging or multi-pitch climbing.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.Hollow Block is made of 6.8mm Technora High Modulus Polyamide fibres.", "product_code": "6000-653", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["4.34kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing"], "Type": ["Single (9.9mm - 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
