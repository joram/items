Its internal regulator equalizes pressure so the burner operates at near max output at low fuel pressure and in cold temperatures. The 1.8L pot holds dinner for two, so this is a fantastic setup for two fast moving hikers. Nesting components keep it compact when packed, and the straining lid expands your menu options beyond ramen and rehydrated meals.1.8L pot with ceramic-coated non-stick surfaces and heat exchanger for versatile cooking.Pot lid has strainer holes plus locking latch to keep it on tight.Pressure regulator provides consistent performance at altitude or when fuel is low.Windproof radiant burner maintains heat levels.227g canister burns for about 95 minutes and boils approximately 18L of water.110g and 227g canisters fit inside.Stove and pot are an integrated system.
