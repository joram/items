Climbs include fourth class and fifth class routes, little-known gems, unpublished quality routes, summer season climbs, and some of the best link-ups in the area. Each one is graded with a rating to illustrate the relative difficulty and degree of engagement required. Routes cover a wide spectrum of alpine experience, though approaches are straightforward and have minimal bushwacking, and all are within weekend striking range of Vancouver.", "product_code": "4016-745", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Rock climbing"], "Regionality": ["British Columbia", "USA"], "Author": ["Kevin Mclane"], "Language": ["English"], "Pages": ["360"], "Published": ["2001"], "Edition": ["1st"], "ISBN": ["9780968247273"], "Made in": ["Canada"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8815583559710/4016745-NOC02.jpg"]}
