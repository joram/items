The IonR 9.4mm is a high-performance rope that's substantial enough for cragging, without weighing down your pack on long approaches. It's a good balance of strength, versatility and smooth handling.DryCore treatment on core yarns reduces yarn-on-yarn abrasion and moisture absorption, so your rope maintains its strength characteristics.Middle mark increases safety and speed on rappels.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material", "product_code": "6009-173", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.99kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
