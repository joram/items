It has a solid hand for easy clipping and a smooth, tight sheath for low drag through gear and over rock, with a low weight and impact force to take on any rock or ice project. The new XEROS dry technology is applied when the nylon is still a filament, treating the entire rope from core to sheath, and resulting in less waste and energy use than traditional treatments.XEROS permanent dry treatment is applied to nylon filaments before they're twisted into yarns. This results in less water absorption through the entire rope and prevents freezing in cold environments.Made with PFOA-free, PFAS-free, and bluesign\u00ae certified raw materials.Bi-colour pattern indicates middle mark to increase safety and speed on rappels.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material", "product_code": "6015-491", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["4.34kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Single (9.9mm - 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
