Superb for crevasse rescue and hauling, or running along a fixed rope back up on slopes. The angled teeth and self-cleaning slot securely grip your rope, even in muddy or icy conditions.Please note that the Tibloc is for emergency or occasional use only and care must be taken to engage the cam correctly.Use only with a minimum of 10mm diameter, round or oval-stock locking carabiners.Use with ropes 8 to 11mm.CE certified.", "product_code": "5045-725", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["35g"], "Ideal for": ["Snow and ice climbing", "Trad and aid climbing"], "Body material": ["Stainless steel"], "Cam material": ["Stainless steel"], "Rope diameter\n\nThe maximum diameter or the range of rope diameter that is compatible with the device.": ["8 -11mm"], "CE certified": ["Yes"], "Made in": ["Indonesia"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807222804510/5045725-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807222837278/5045725-NOC02-ALT-INUSE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807222902814/5045725-NOC02-ALT-DETAIL.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9089995407390/5045725-NOC02-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807222804510/5045725-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807222837278/5045725-NOC02-ALT-INUSE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8807222902814/5045725-NOC02-ALT-DETAIL.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9089995407390/5045725-NOC02-ALT-SIDE.jpg"]}
