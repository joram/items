Fromme offers a wide selection of trails ranging from park style flow to gruelling cross country climbs. Many of the trails are short but this makes putting together your own loop all the better! Fromme is the only North Shore mountain that cannot be shuttled. Nearly all of the trails require you to earn your turns. While most riders still choose to access the trails higher on the hill via the gravel access road, over the past few years a number of climbing options have been developed for those who are looking to stick to the single track. This hand crafted map was developed by lifelong locals and includes over 90 trails and descriptions of the five riding zones including the LSCR. Detailed topographic information including recommend parking areas, 20m contours, water bodies, and transportation routes will help you find your way.", "product_code": "5051-611", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Mountain biking"], "Regionality": ["British Columbia"], "Language": ["English"], "Published": ["2016"], "Edition": ["12th"], "Scale": ["1:12,000"], "Made in": ["Canada"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8850817581086/5051611-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8851105611806/5051611-NOC02-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8850817581086/5051611-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8851105611806/5051611-NOC02-ALT-OPEN.jpg"]}
