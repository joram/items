With a wood core from toe to tail and a carbon backbone to stiffen it up, the Backland 98 lets you reach deep mountain terrain and quickly lap your skintrack for another powder hit. The HRZN Tech tip is spoon-shaped to provide extra float in powder. Reach all the best stashes, pick your line and drop in.Core is made of poplar and beech wood to bring the weight as low as possible.Carbon Backbone adds snap and edge-hold with very minimal weight penality.HRZN Tech spoon-like tip reduces deflection and improves control in powder.Full sidewall construction improves steering.Powder Rocker is 20% rocker in the tip, 10% in the tail, and 70% camber underfoot for maximum stability in weird conditions and float in deep powder.7000-series sintered base holds wax very well for fast glide in any snow conditions.Topsheets are lightweight and wear-resistant.", "product_code": "6011-295", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["2.24kg (164cm)"], "Ideal for": ["Freeride and freeskiing", "Alpine touring"], "Snow conditions": ["Powder", "Mixed"], "Terrain": ["Off-Piste"], "Ability\n\nBeginner: new or getting back into skiing.
