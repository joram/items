The sheath is braided on a machine with 48 bobbins, making it supple, with great hand-feel and abrasion-resistance. UIAA certified EcoDry treatment absorbs less than 2% of it's weight in water, so it stays light and is less susceptible to freezing in wet, cold conditions.ColorTec sheath pattern change provides a permanent middle mark.Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating.EcoDry finish makes this rope durably water-repellent and dirt-resistant without the use of PFCs.3D lap coiled so you can use it straight away without kinking or tangling.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product", "product_code": "6014-245", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.42kg (60 Meter)", "3.99kg (70 Meter)"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
