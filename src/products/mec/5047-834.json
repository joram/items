The girls' jacket is cut long through the body so it offers full coverage.Shell is abrasion-resistant 75-denier polyester with a polyurethane waterproof breathable coating and a DWR (durable water repellency) finish.Fully lined with soft polyester microfleece that adds a bit more warmth for cool days.Zippered hand pockets for thawing fingers.Storm flap over zipper keeps weather out.Elasticized cuffs seal out the cold and damp.Reflective details for low-light visibility.", "product_code": "5047-834", "tech_specs": {"Ideal for": ["Casual wear", "Camping and hiking"], "Type": ["Waterproof-breathable"], "Technology": ["Microporous PU laminate"], "Construction": ["2-layer"], "Face fabric": ["75-denier polyester"], "Lining/backer": ["Polyester"], "Fabric waterproof rating\n\nThe standard test for waterproof fabrics uses a standing column filled with water.  The figures given are the water column height.  A rating of 3,500mm or higher can be considered waterproof.  The higher the rating, the more durable the waterproof fabric will be over time.": ["14,000mm"], "Waterproofness\n\nWaterproof garments use waterproof-breathable technologies and are fully seam-taped.
