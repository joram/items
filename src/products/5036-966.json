It can be pulled in rapidly for fast reuse or repacking. The tow line has a pliable float, a large stainless steel carabiner and an internal secondary attachment that allows a variety of flexible towing solutions.Tow line pouch lays nearly flat when opened.50ft. x \u00bcin. dynamic shock absorbing polypropylene line meets Canadian Coast Guard requirements as buoyant heaving line.Mesh drainage prevents water collection and reduces drag, allowing fast retrieval after jettison.Attachment point for the rope/webbing allows the jettisoned bag to drag less in the water and as it's pulled back.Daisy chain loop allows the rope to be attached for a shorter tow.Pliable high-friction float can be moved or removed to accommodate towing more than one boat.Float can be slid up the line for multi-boat tows rather than tied off with an overhand knot to speed up tow rigging,External anchoring point allows immediate access to the carabiner.", "product_code": "5036-966", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["430g"], "Ideal for": ["Kayak touring"], "Rope material": ["Polypropylene"], "Rope length": ["15.24m"], "Rope diameter": ["6.4mm"], "Meets Transport Canada safety requirement": ["Yes"], "Made in": ["Canada"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817849532446/5036966-GRY35.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817849794590/5036966-GRY35-ALT-CLOSED.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817849827358/5036966-GRY35-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817850187806/5036966-GRY35-ALT-ROLLED.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817849532446/5036966-GRY35.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817849794590/5036966-GRY35-ALT-CLOSED.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817849827358/5036966-GRY35-ALT-OPEN.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8817850187806/5036966-GRY35-ALT-ROLLED.jpg"]}
