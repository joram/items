Intelligent power management software tracks your battery\u2019s status at all times. Modes and settings are easily changed, giving you enough power for the last kilometer or the next 50. One key reason that Suunto is able to achieve these runtimes is its FusedTrack system. Data from the onboard sensors is combined with limited GPS readings (1 every 1 to 2 minutes), creating a near\u2013GPS-quality track without needing to constantly power the GPS. Preloaded with more than 80 activity profiles, the 9 series is ready for any sport. The optical heart rate monitor adds an extra layer of precision to your training. Pair your watch with a compatible smartphone running the Movescount app, and the 9 Baro gains a whole new feature set. Movescount lets you transfer activities, receive notifications, plan routes using heatmaps, share activities to your social channels, and more. Heatmaps are one of Suunto\u2019s coolest features \u2013 they display other Movescount users' activities over local maps, making it easier to find the best runs, rides, trails or swims. Full activity tracking features record your steps and calories, as well as monitor the quality of your sleep, for a 24/7 picture of performance the 9 Baro uses to calculate your recovery times and track your progress.Equipped with Valencell\u2019s optical heart rate monitor (version 1.2), which provides reliable constant heart rate data and allows you to train without a chest strap.Optical heart rate sensors measure changes in blood volume under the skin, and work best when worn snugly, 1 to 3 finger-widths above your wrist bone.Spot check your heart rate at any point and receive a graph of 10 minutes\u2019 or 12 hours\u2019 worth of heart rate data. During an activity, heart rate data is collected every second.FusedTrack\u2122 uses data from the internal sensors to plot your route between GPS points. By combining the data, you get a track that mirrors your actual track, while only checking into GPS once or twice a minute. All of that means a greatly increased battery life. Currently only works for running and trail running, with open water swimming in the works.FusedAlti\u2122 uses a combination of GPS and barometric data to extrapolate the most accurate altitude possible.FusedSpeed\u2122 combines GPS and accelerometer data to provide a more stable running pace.Pre-set intelligent battery profiles change modes to get specific runtimes and features out of the remaining battery.Custom battery profiles allow you to set up exactly what you need for an activity. Saving these modes lets you have specific battery profiles for different activities.Dynamic battery monitoring suggests power changes on the fly, ensuring you have power for the remainder of your activity.Low-battery detection mode switches off everything but the activity timer.Intelligent battery reminders learn your activity patterns and remind you to charge your watch leading up to your activity.Movescount web interface allows customization of modes and display, as well as competition and comparison of activities with other Movescount users, letting you race against friends from all over the world.Movescount enables sharing your metrics with coaches and personal trainers, opening up a whole world of digital training plans and tips.Keeps track of your personal bests by sport and shows progress trends for activities including running, cycling, swimming (Bluetooth heart rate belt required for optimal accuracy in the water), and many more. Seeing these trends is a quick and easy way to gauge the effectiveness of your training.Loaded with more than 80 different sport modes, from running to swimming, cycling and many more.24/7 activity tracking lets it learn your activity level and guide you towards a more active lifestyle.Sleep tracking monitors the quality of your sleep, when you turn in and total sleep, which it uses to calculate recovery times and progress.Barometric altimeter helps you track your ascents, descents and total elevation changes.Storm alarm tracks pressure changes and alerts you when it\u2019s time to find shelter.Tilt compensated digital compass helps keep you headed in the right direction.Bluetooth Smart connects to myriad fitness sensors, from power meters to footpods, as well as smartphones featuring Bluetooth 4.0.Automatically syncs data to paired smartphones running either of the free Suunto apps, Movescount or Suunto.Smart notifications (emails, texts, alerts and more) via Bluetooth connection to a compatible smartphone.Free software updates add functionality and improve performance.User-friendly strap changes, thanks to quick-release pins.
