Each member of this dynamic duo can go it alone, but combined, they give you a way to charge just about any electronic device from, well, just about anywhere.Nomad 10 monocrystalline solar panel is light, folds compactly and can be chained with other panels.Rated power is 10W.USB port (output) is 5V, up to 1.5A (7.5W max), regulated.Venture 30 uses a Li-NMC (lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide) battery for longer life and greater safety than lithium-ion models.Recharges via the Nomad 10 Solar Panel in 4.5-9 hours or via a 2A USB source in 5 hours.Built-in charging and low-battery protection extend battery life.Dual output ports let you recharge two devices at once.Built-in 150 Lumen flashlight for night ops.IPX6 waterproof rating allows use in the rain.", "product_code": "6013-466", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["760g"], "Ideal for": ["Everyday use", "Travel", "Emergency preparedness"], "Output voltage": ["5volts"], "Charge time via solar\n\nEstimated charging time under optimal conditions.": ["4.5-9\u00a0h"], "Charge time via USB": ["5\u00a0h"], "Folded dimensions": ["18.4\u00a0x\u00a03.2\u00a0x\u00a024.1cm"], "Batteries": ["1 18650 (included)"], "USB Port\n\nHas a Type A USB port for charging your electronic devices.": ["Yes"], "Charging level indicator": ["Yes"], "Auto shutoff\n\nDoes unit have an auto shutoff feature so that unit stops charging when batteries are full?": ["Yes"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146826588190/6013466-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9145995526174/6013466-NOC02-ALT-INSITU.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817871902/6013466-NOC02-ALT-SOLARPANEL.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817904670/6013466-NOC02-ALT-SOLARPANELBACK.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817937438/6013466-NOC02-ALT-VENTURE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817970206/6013466-NOC02-ALT-VENTUREPORTS.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146826588190/6013466-NOC02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9145995526174/6013466-NOC02-ALT-INSITU.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817871902/6013466-NOC02-ALT-SOLARPANEL.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817904670/6013466-NOC02-ALT-SOLARPANELBACK.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817937438/6013466-NOC02-ALT-VENTURE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9146817970206/6013466-NOC02-ALT-VENTUREPORTS.jpg"]}
