Ideal for intermediate climbers looking to project routes and progress up grades.Beal ropes have lower impact forces than most brands. This reduces forces on the anchor, belayer, and climber.Thermo fluid treatment stabilizes the sheath and keeps it compact for better handling.No chemical treatments or dyes used in the construction.Beal plants a tree for every rope sold.", "product_code": "5045-926", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.66kg"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing"], "Type": ["Single (9.9mm - 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath. Dry (UIAA certified) ropes have both core and sheath treated, plus meet the UIAA Water Repellent standard by passing a stringent test where a soaked rope cannot absorb more than 5% of the rope's weight.": ["Non-dry"], "Length": ["60m"], "Dynamic elongation\n\nMaximum elongation in the first UIAA test fall, where a weight is attached to the rope and then dropped. Higher numbers indicate stretchier ropes.": ["34%"], "Static elongation\n\nIn controlled tests, a weight is suspended from the rope (not dropped). Higher numbers indicate stretchier ropes.": ["8%"], "Impact force\n\nThe amount of force, in kN, that the first UIAA fall puts on the falling object. Less impact force puts less force on the climber, belayer, and protection during a fall.": ["7.2kN"], "Linear weight": ["61g/m"], "Diameter": ["9.8mm"], "Halfway pattern change": ["No"], "UIAA fall rating\n\nIndicates the number of consecutive falls a rope withstood during testing in a controlled environment.
