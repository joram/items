Countersunk drill holes prevent stress points where the wire enters, and help protect the wire from wear.Tumbled to remove sharp edges that might hinder placements.Wires are matched to nut size, so they can be placed at full reach without flopping.Full size crimp used in wire for strength.Lightening holes in the larger sizes reduce weight.", "product_code": "5017-917", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["28g (7)", "30g (8)", "39g (9)", "46g (10)", "55g (11)"], "Ideal for": ["Trad and aid climbing"], "Head": ["Aluminum"], "Stem": ["Double stainless steel"], "Strength\n\nThe maximum force generated by a fall the equipment can withstand.
