The Canary is one of the lightest and thinnest single ropes out there, making it a good choice for anyone looking to go fast and light or for hard redpoints. It's not a suitable choice for working routes or top roping, but the thicker sheath proportion does add durability for such a slim rope.Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating.Pro Dry finish makes this rope durably water repellent and dirt resistant.3D lap coiled so you can use the rope right out of the package.Rope is 47% sheath for durability.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.Meets testing standards to certify it as a single, half or twin, specs shown are for single rope tests.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product", "product_code": "5063-639", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.57kg"], "Ideal for": ["Snow and ice climbing", "Rock climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)", "Half", "Twin"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
