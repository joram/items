The upper is made with a non-stretchy microfibre and a soft liner for a plush next-to-skin feel. The moderate downturn and asymmetry, paired with the Z-shaped Wave strap closure, helps keep precision in the toes without the compression of a high-performance shoe. This shoe is a great stepping stone for a climber looking to transition from a beginner climbing shoe to a more performance oriented shoe.Microfibre upper ensures a consistent fit over time and a soft liner adds comfort and durability.Slightly asymmetric, curved shape for precise foot placement in steep and slabby terrain.Z-strap closure system spreads the pressure of cinching down the strap across the upper and allows for lots of adjustment.1.5mm Talyn midsole supports your foot when edging.V-Tension randing system holds your forefoot securely in place.Vibram\u00ae XS Grip 2 rubber provides exceptional friction and sensitivity.Members typically downsize 1-1.5 sizes (performance fit) or 0.5-1 sizes (comfort fit) from their street shoe size.", "product_code": "5062-825", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["440g (40)"], "Ideal for": ["Indoor climbing", "Bouldering", "Sport and toprope climbing"], "Type\n\nA neutral shoe suits long routes and cracks.
