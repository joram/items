UPF 50+ protection shields your head when there's no shade in sight, and a broad brim and DWR finish keep you dry when storm clouds gather. A stealthy pocket in the crown holds extra cash or your passport for those times you don't want to wear a money belt. A well-designed dual cord system keeps it on your head, even in the face of gale-force winds, but if you happen to drop it overboard, the wide foam brim keeps it afloat until you can retrieve it. If it gets a little squished in your suitcase or backpack, just pour a little water into the crown, swish it around, dampen the outside and reform with your hands to bring it back to its former shape.Durable nylon fabric has UPF 50+ sun protection and a DWR finish to shed light rain.Polyester mesh encircles the crown to vent hot air and keep your head cool and comfortable.Hydrofil\u00ae sweatband wicks moisture from your brow.Wide foam brim keeps hat afloat should it fall in the water.Hidden crown pocket keeps small essentials safe while travelling.Dual wind cord system keeps hat secure in gusty conditions.", "product_code": "5061-708", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["85g (7 3/4)"], "Ideal for": ["Travel", "Backpacking", "Beach", "Kayaking"], "Fabric content": ["100% nylon"], "Secondary fabric": ["100% polyester"], "UPF rating\n\nThe Ultraviolet Protection Factor rating indicates how effective a fabric is at blocking out solar ultraviolet radiation.": ["40-50+ (Blocks ~97.5% of UVA/UVB)"], "Made in": ["China"]}, "img_urls": ["https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163329077278/5061708-SAG01.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163326783518/5061708-SAG01-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163326816286/5061708-LST02-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8975778283550/5061708-KHA11-ALT-FRONT.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9027934126110/5061708-KHA11-ALT-LIFESTYLE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163328946206/5061708-LST02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8968865808414/5061708-KHA11.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163329077278/5061708-SAG01.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163326783518/5061708-SAG01-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163326816286/5061708-LST02-ALT-SIDE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8975778283550/5061708-KHA11-ALT-FRONT.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9027934126110/5061708-KHA11-ALT-LIFESTYLE.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/9163328946206/5061708-LST02.jpg", "https://cdn.mec.ca/medias/sys_master/high-res/high-res/8968865808414/5061708-KHA11.jpg"]}
