Learn how your body responds to: exercise, rest and sleep. The Elevate optical heart rate monitor takes your pulse straight off your wrist, no need for a chest strap. Running metrics like speed and distance are handled by the onboard GPS and internal accelerometers. These sensors turn your movement into data, making sure you get credit for all you do, in the gym and trails. Paired with your phone via Garmin Connect, you can review activities, receive notifications, download training plans, keep an eye on the weather, and control phone apps; like music players.
