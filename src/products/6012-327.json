With enough room to carry the 10 essentials and then some, the Tempest 20 lets you go off the grid without weighing yourself down. A ventilated back panel and harness keep the load close to your body for comfortable carrying, and let air in to cool your back, while the continuous-wrap hipbelt stabilizes your load to keep you balanced on rocks and logs, or while hauling groceries.Mesh-covered die-cut foam hipbelt, shoulder straps and back panel are lightweight and let air flow.Women\u2019s-specific design features a shorter torso length, shoulder straps that are set closer together and a hipbelt shaped to fit curvier hips.Seamlessly integrated lumbar pad and hipbelt transfers weight without rubbing.Stretch-mesh pockets on the shoulder strap, hip belt, sides and front are easy to access on the go.Stow-on-the-Go trekking pole attachment lets you stash your poles without taking off your pack.Ice axe loop and a LidLock helmet attachment for multi-sport carry options.External hydration sleeve accommodates a 3L reservoir (sold separately) and is easy to load and unload without opening the main compartment.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Bluesign\u00ae Approved Material\n\n\n\n\n\n.st0{stroke:#333;stroke-width:.79;stroke-miterlimit:10}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Recycled content", "product_code": "6012-327", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["900g (Extra Small/Small)", "1.02kg (Medium/Large)"], "Ideal for": ["Day hiking"], "Main fabric": ["210-denier ripstop nylon"], "Secondary fabric": ["420-denier nylon"], "Access\n\nThe location of all access points into the main compartment of the pack.": ["Clamshell zip"], "Hipbelt": ["Padded"], "Volume": ["18L (Extra Small/Small)", "20L (Medium/Large)"], "Length": ["46cm (Extra Small/Small)", "51cm (Medium/Large)"], "Width": ["27cm"], "Depth": ["23cm"], "Ventilated back panel": ["Yes"], "Carry-on sized\n\nSize restrictions vary among airlines.
