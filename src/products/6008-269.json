The Thru-Link high-flow filter system connects to your reservoir hose, so you just dip, drink and get back on the trail. Two-stage filtration gives you safe and taste-free water on demand, and the pump-free design can be used in a gravity system at basecamp.Fast-flow hollow fibre technology uses polymer fibres remove particulate and pathogens.Activated carbon reduces chemicals and tastes.Quick-connect adapter can connect to any hydration reservoir system.Nominal 1000L filter life is for clear water.", "product_code": "6008-269", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["70g"], "Ideal for": ["Camping and hiking", "Backpacking", "Trail running"], "Filter type\n\nWater can be treated using various types of filters, chemicals or non-chemical purification methods, or a combination.
