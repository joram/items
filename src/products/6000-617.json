Garmin knows that instinct is usually all that separates a great story from a bad day. The rugged new Instinct GPS Watch helps stack the deck in your favour and is another tool to help get you home safe. A powerful, internal antenna connects 3 different satellite constellations: GPS, GLONASS and Galileo. Multiple networks, combined with satellite position caching, give you a fast connection and a strong GPS signal wherever you are. Built-in navigation tools let you navigate to saved coordinates, follow courses you've created in Garmin Connect, or just find your way back to the car. The Instinct pairs GPS data with the onboard accelerometer to provide training metrics like speed and distance information. The latest Elevate optical heart rate monitor reads your pulse information straight off your wrist, so there's no need to wear a chest strap. Multiple sport profiles add custom metrics to your training data, letting you train smarter for all your activities. Pair the Instinct with the free Garmin Connect\u2122 app on your phone to review activities, set up live tracking sessions, monitor real-time weather forecasting, receive notifications, control apps and much more.Connects to GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations for fast signal acquisition and a strong connection nearly anywhere.Satellite caching allows your Instinct to save satellite data so it knows where to look for them when you turn it on, giving you a fast and accurate satellite signal in any terrain.Tilt compensated 3-axis electronic compass shows your heading even when you're stationary, so you're always facing the right direction.Barometric altimeter helps you track your ascents, descents and total elevation changes.Storm alarm tracks pressure changes and alerts you when it\u2019s time to find shelter. Extended weather data can also come in via the connection to your smartphone.Extend battery life by selecting different GPS modes to find the perfect balance of GPS accuracy and time until your next recharge.UltraTrac\u2122 mode reduces the GPS recording rate to conserve battery life, allowing you to stay in the field longer (up to 40 hours).Built-in activity modes for hiking, biking, running, strength training (with rep counter), walking, swimming (indoor only) and more.
