Individual yarns are coated with Teflon to reduce friction. The yarns slide past each other, so each is weighted equally when the rope is loaded.Thermo Shield treatment gives it excellent handling properties, a supple feel and an impressive strength rating.Pro Dry finish makes this rope durably water repellent and dirt resistant.3D lap coiled so it can be used straight out of the package without having to pre-flake it.Meets UIAA standard water-repellent test, meaning this rope is fast-drying, absorbs virtually no water and resists freezing.\n\n        Sustainability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.bluesign-cls-1,.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{fill:none;}.bluesign-cls-2,.bluesign-cls-3{stroke:#333;stroke-width:1.79px;}.bluesign-cls-2{stroke-linejoin:round;}.bluesign-cls-3{stroke-miterlimit:10;}\n\nBluesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Certified Bluesign\u00ae Product", "product_code": "5063-424", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["3.72kg (60 Meter)", "4.34kg (70 Meter)"], "Ideal for": ["Rock climbing", "Snow and ice climbing"], "Type": ["Single (\u2039 9.6mm)"], "Treatment\n\nDry ropes have a water-resistant treatment on both core and sheath.
