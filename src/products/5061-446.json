This trusty 2-in-1 travel pack features two sections: a day pack with padded shoulder straps and hipbelt, and a detachable cargo pack for clothing and toiletries. When you board the plane, unclip the cargo pack and stow it in the overhead bin, then stash the daypack under the seat in front of you for easy access to travel essentials like your laptop (in a dedicated sleeve), headphones, book and snacks. When you land, clip the cargo pack back on and carry the whole thing comfortably to your guesthouse, thanks to the sturdy suspension of the Lightwire frame. The cargo pack's wide opening makes for easy packing, and straps let you compress the load in case you pick up too many souvenirs.Women's specific fit uses a shoulder harness and hipbelt designed to fit the curves of a woman's neck, shoulders, chest and hips for optimal load transfer and support.Daypack's Lightwire frame supports the load in comfort, whether carried separately or with the cargo bag attached.Dedicated laptop sleeve and organizer pockets in the day pack carry in-transit essentials.Duffle-style cargo pack has a wide opening for easy loading and compression straps to cinch everything in tight.", "product_code": "5061-446", "tech_specs": {"Weight": ["1.81kg"], "Ideal for": ["Travel"], "Padded sleeve fits most\n\nA padded slot to fit electronics or laptops, it may be partially or fully padded on each side.": ["15-inch laptop"], "Access\n\nThe location of all access points into the main compartment of the pack.": ["Clamshell zip"], "Hipbelt": ["Padded"], "Volume": ["60L"], "Length": ["51cm"], "Width": ["35cm"], "Depth": ["38cm"], "Carry-on sized\n\nSize restrictions vary among airlines.
