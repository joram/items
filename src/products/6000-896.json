The figures given are the water column height.  A rating of 3,500mm or higher can be considered waterproof.  The higher the rating, the more durable the waterproof fabric will be over time.": ["28,000mm"], "Waterproofness\n\nWaterproof garments use waterproof-breathable technologies and are fully seam-taped. Water-resistant garments use waterproof-breathable technologies but their seams are not taped. Water-resistant garments repel water and protect against wind but are not made of waterproof fabric.": ["Waterproof with fully taped seams"], "Fabric active breathability\n\nThe rate at which a waterproof breathable fabric expels moisture when the inner surface is moist from perspiration.
